> I'm like that co-worker who drives an old junker. When you ask them, "How do you keep that thing running?", the advice you get will be useful...but probably no replacement for hiring a real mechanic. [View all Jalopy Articles here](/jalopy/).

You designed your game, wrote some adventures, laid out a zine, filled it with public domain artwork, funded and printed it. Your backers got their copies and everyone is happy. 

That is incredible work, and you should be proud of all you've accomplished. Time for a nap...

**BUT WAIT!** 

Now you have a bunch of surplus games sitting in your basement. You could try to sell them yourself, but that's gonna be tricky. You may not be equipped to handle things like...

- Packaging
- Shipping
- Marketing
- Growing an Audience
- Customer Service
- Storage

That's a LOT! You'd be signing up for a part-time job just to sell the remaining copies of your game. And what about when they finally sell out? Will you order another reprint and keep selling copies? Can you handle all of this?

If yes, please let me know because I want you to sell my books as well.

## Overview

This article will cover the basics of getting your games into online retailers and celebrate some of the incredible storefronts that fuel our hobby.

At the end of the article is an in-depth series of interviews with a bunch of these storefronts. Even if you don't have a book to pitch, you should check out some of these storefronts and fall in love with a new game. 

We will NOT be discussing brick and mortar stores or big-box retailers like Barnes and Noble or Amazon. There's a wealth of info about how to navigate those waters.

Let's cover some Pitch Basics

## Making the Pitch

Interacting with these smaller storefronts is a great way to refine your pitch, make connections, and meet some really cool people. The online retailers mentioned in this article are talented, hard-working, and passionate about our hobby. They regularly take risks on newer creators and help us find bigger audiences. 

Thankfully, the retailers in our hobby are friendly and approachable. However they are also busy and professional, so treat their time with respect and put some effort into your communication.

**Step 1**: Visit their store. It sounds dumb, but take an hour and browse their site. See what kinds of game they sell. How do they present their stock? What is their vibe? And lastly find the write email to contact them. Some stores have different email addresses for different reasons. If they have a contact form on their site, USE IT!

**Step 2**: Consider your Pitch. Advice for pitching and marketing is everywhere, but you REALLY want to make sure you have it down-pat before you pitch to a retailer. They'll be a major customer and will echo your pitch to their customers.

**Step 3**: Set Your Price. It's not the job of a retailer to decide how much to charge for your game. Be direct about your prices and if the store has any questions they'll ask. Don't make them figure it out. Some lingo about prices:

- Retail Value: How much a customer will pay for your book.
- Wholesale Cost: How much the store pays for your book.

Usually the Wholesale is 50% of the Retail price. So if you want to sell your game to customers for $30 then your Wholesale cost is $15. The store will buy X copies from you for $15 and sell them to customers for $30.

**Step 4**: Draft your email. Do this ahead of time and let it simmer for a bit before you send it. Don't rush this, first impressions matter. Here's a simple template for your initial pitch:

> Hello STORENAME! 
> My name is YOUR NAME and my newest game, GAME NAME, might be a good fit for your store.

> STORE COMPLIMENT (1 sentence, talk about something you like)
> GAME PITCH (2-3 sentences. shorter is better)
> BOOK DETAILS (page count, size, hardcover/softcover, retail price, etc)
> IMAGE (Optional, keep it small so it doesn't clutter the email)
> GAME PDF LINK (Or attached to the email. Make sure you mention it is attached)
> PRESS KIT LINK (optional, but VERY useful in case they want to learn more)

> Would you be interested in carrying any copies of GAME NAME in your store? 

>Thanks for taking the time to consider my offer.

>      -  YOUR NAME

**Step 5**: Send it! Once you're confident that you're putting your best foot forward, click SEND. Breathe. Whew. Good work. I guess its' time for a nap...

**Step 6**: No naps! Review your pitch, your email, and wait for the store to respond. If they haven't responded after a week or two, send a gentle followup email like:

> Hello STORE NAME
> I was curious if you were interested in carrying copies of GAME NAME. If it isn't a good fit I completely understand and I thank you for your time.

>          - YOUR NAME

**Step 7**: If they responded positively then be prepared to package up your boxes and ship them the games they requested. You'll likely be responsible for the initial shipping cost.

Whether they responded positively or negatively, you should start working on the pitch for another store. It's not rude to pitch to multiple retailers and get your books in multiple stores. Unless you have some kind of special deal with a retailer, then you should try and get your book in as many stores as possible.

**Step 8**: Watch the store. Check on it every so often and follow their social media channels. When they announce your game is available, echo it far and wide! Bring your audience to their store. It helps both of you.

## Interviews

Along with the general advice above, I reached out to some of the wonderful stores that bring us together. Their answers are packed with valuable information and some fun trivia. Simply click a store name to view their answers to each question.

### Tell us about your store! Where did you come up with the name?

<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>The shop was created out of our desire to make indie RPGs more accessible to folks living north of the US. And isn't it ironic, don't you think, that our US customers still pay less for shipping than people with a canadian address? (Population density and geography factor in higher postage rates). The shop is operated by me (Drago), my partner Tess, and is supported by our rat mischief (The rats live in a separate space from our inventory. Although they are the cleanest of animals, some people might be allergic so we keep them separate).</p>
<p>We wanted a name that sounds a bit whimsical, that could also be a name of a crust-punk or a black metal band, or the name of some magical creatures you encounter within a game you're playing. The worry was that "ratti incantati" sounds too foreign to a primarily English-speaking audience but all the friends from our RPG circle loved it so we went with that one. Chaos Matriarch was a close contender but we decided that one sounded a tad too pompous. </p>

### What do you NEED to know from a product pitch?

<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>Tell us something about you (and other people involved). We need to know what your game is about. What's the name of it? What's the MSRP/retail price? Number of pages? Is it a zine or a paperback or a hardback? Is it ready? What's the minimum quantity? Are complimentary digital files included (I forget to ask this 99% of the time). What game system does it use? </p>
</details>

### What would you LIKE to know?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>We'd like to know if a game is a good fit for our store. Most of the games we carry empower the players in one way or another. It's less likely we'll carry a game that makes the players feel utterly hopeless, or puts them in the role of murder hobos. It's doubtful we'll carry a game that puts the players in the role of cops or in situations where they'll be helping law enforcement. We won't carry a game that promotes hate, uses NFTs, or AI "art". Browsing around our store before sending us a pitch is generally a good idea. </p>
</details>

### What should NOT be included in a pitch?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>

  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>Nudes. </p>
</details>

### Should we pitch only when we have the printed books in hand? Or earlier?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>Your zine/book does not have to be ready for print when you send us your pitch but you should probably have a realistic time-frame on when your game is going to come out.  </p>
</details>

### Should pitches include images, files, videos, and ad copy?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>Include whatever media you have. Or give us a link to it.  </p>
</details>

### How can we feature your store in our marketing?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>It would be wonderful if you could put a link on your website/twitter/instagram/newsletter that directs people to your game in our store. We're happy to provide you with any of our logos should you need it. </p>
</details>

### How will you provide marketing and exposure to our products?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>We send out newsletters whenever we have new products in stock. We promote the games we carry through paid ads on facebook and Instagram. We post on twitter. We also do our own product photography so in most cases you can expect to see some nice photos of your zine/book on our social media. </p>
</details>

### Can we pitch to multiple stores? Is that polite?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>We do not believe in exclusivity. We have great relationships with other zine stores owners and frequently promote their shops. Many stores, just like us, also function as distributors and we often buy zines from different publishers from them. Maybe having a distributor is a good option for you too? Talk to us about it! </p>
</details>

### Should we ask about restocks? Or wait for you to reach out?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>If you see that your books are close to being sold out or are sold out in our store already, don't hesitate to remind us!</p>
</details>

### Is your store currently accepting new products?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>We are operating on a minimal budget with a long waiting list of games to buy, which is not ideal. Don't let that discourage you though! You do want to get on that list! </p>
</details>

### Anything else you want to add?
<details>
  <summary>ratti incantati</summary>
  <p><img src="/images/posts/pitching_ratti.png" class="leftSmallImg"></p>
  <p>Store Page: <a href="https://rattiincantati.com/">https://rattiincantati.com/</a></p>
  <p>As we're dirt poor, our inventory is heavily curated. There are at least 10 times more games we'd like to stock than we actually can so we need to make cuts. Again - don't let that discourage you! Your game is more likely to move up on our list if it fits nicely with what we already stock, so browse around before you contact us, if you have the time. Games featuring rats, goblins, or mushrooms will certainly get you on our good side. Kid friendly games, as well as satanic mechanics are what we're in to too. And we can never have enough rebellions against tyrants, vampiric or otherwise! Your game doesn't have to be anywhere near perfect but we do need to feel that it comes from the heart and that you believe in it.  </p>
