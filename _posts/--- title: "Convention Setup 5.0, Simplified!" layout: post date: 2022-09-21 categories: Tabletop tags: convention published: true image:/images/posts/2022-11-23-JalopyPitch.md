> I'm like that co-worker who drives an old junker. When you ask them, "How do you keep that thing running?", the advice you get will be useful...but probably no replacement for hiring a real mechanic. [View all Jalopy Articles here](/jalopy/).

You designed your game, wrote some adventures, laid out a zine, filled it with public domain artwork, funded and printed it. Your backers got their copies and everyone is happy. 

That is incredible work, and you should be proud of all you've accomplished. Time for a nap...

**BUT WAIT!** 

Now you have a bunch of surplus games sitting in your basement. You could try to sell them yourself, but that's gonna be tricky. You may not be equipped to handle things like...

- Packaging
- Shipping
- Marketing
- Growing an Audience
- Customer Service
- Storage

That's a LOT! You'd be signing up for a part-time job just to sell the remaining copies of your game. And what about when they finally sell out? Will you order another reprint and keep selling copies? Can you handle all of this?

If yes, please let me know because I want you to sell my books as well.

## Overview

This article will cover the basics of getting your games into online retailers and celebrate some of the incredible storefronts that fuel our hobby.

At the end of the article is an in-depth series of interviews with a bunch of these storefronts. Even if you don't have a book to pitch, you should check out some of these storefronts and fall in love with a new game. 

We will NOT be discussing brick and mortar stores or big-box retailers like Barnes and Noble or Amazon. There's a wealth of info about how to navigate those waters.

Let's cover some Pitch Basics

## Making the Pitch

Interacting with these smaller storefronts is a great way to refine your pitch, make connections, and meet some really cool people. The online retailers mentioned in this article are talented, hard-working, and passionate about our hobby. They regularly take risks on newer creators and help us find bigger audiences. 

Thankfully, the retailers in our hobby are friendly and approachable. However they are also busy and professional, so treat their time with respect and put some effort into your communication.

**Step 1**: Visit their store. It sounds dumb, but take an hour and browse their site. See what kinds of game they sell. How do they present their stock? What is their vibe? And lastly find the write email to contact them. Some stores have different email addresses for different reasons. If they have a contact form on their site, USE IT!

**Step 2**: Consider your Pitch. Advice for pitching and marketing is everywhere, but you REALLY want to make sure you have it down-pat before you pitch to a retailer. They'll be a major customer and will echo your pitch to their customers.

**Step 3**: Set Your Price. It's not the job of a retailer to decide how much to charge for your game. Be direct about your prices and if the store has any questions they'll ask. Don't make them figure it out. Some lingo about prices:

- Retail Value: How much a customer will pay for your book.
- Wholesale Cost: How much the store pays for your book.

Usually the Wholesale is 50% of the Retail price. So if you want to sell your game to customers for $30 then your Wholesale cost is $15. The store will buy X copies from you for $15 and sell them to customers for $30.

**Step 4**: Draft your email. Do this ahead of time and let it simmer for a bit before you send it. Don't rush this, first impressions matter. Here's a simple template for your initial pitch:

> Hello STORENAME! 
> My name is YOUR NAME and my newest game, GAME NAME, might be a good fit for your store.

> STORE COMPLIMENT (1 sentence, talk about something you like)
> GAME PITCH (2-3 sentences. shorter is better)
> BOOK DETAILS (page count, size, hardcover/softcover, retail price, etc)
> IMAGE (Optional, keep it small so it doesn't clutter the email)
> GAME PDF LINK (Or attached to the email. Make sure you mention it is attached)
> PRESS KIT LINK (optional, but VERY useful in case they want to learn more)

> Would you be interested in carrying any copies of GAME NAME in your store? 

>Thanks for taking the time to consider my offer.

>      -  YOUR NAME

**Step 5**: Send it! Once you're confident that you're putting your best foot forward, click SEND. Breathe. Whew. Good work. I guess its' time for a nap...

**Step 6**: No naps! Review your pitch, your email, and wait for the store to respond. If they haven't responded after a week or two, send a gentle followup email like:

> Hello STORE NAME
> I was curious if you were interested in carrying copies of GAME NAME. If it isn't a good fit I completely understand and I thank you for your time.

>          - YOUR NAME

**Step 7**: If they responded positively then be prepared to package up your boxes and ship them the games they requested. You'll likely be responsible for the initial shipping cost.

Whether they responded positively or negatively, you should start working on the pitch for another store. It's not rude to pitch to multiple retailers and get your books in multiple stores. Unless you have some kind of special deal with a retailer, then you should try and get your book in as many stores as possible.

**Step 8**: Watch the store. Check on it every so often and follow their social media channels. When they announce your game is available, echo it far and wide! Bring your audience to their store. It helps both of you.

## Conclusion

I cannot stress enough how valuable it can be to get your book into an online store. Aside from making a little money you will grow your audience, forge new connections, and gain confidence in marketing your creations.

We are so lucky to have alternatives to bloated corporate nonsense, and everyone on this list deserves your support and attention.

Consider shipping with them and continue to support indie creators and the flourishing of our awesome hobby.

I hope to see all featured in more stores! Good luck!
