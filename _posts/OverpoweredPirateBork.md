Frigid.Procyon.11 is different than other explorer bots. While his brothers and sisters search for gold, creatures, and new horizons, Procyon seeks ART. 

Of course, some forms of art are valuable treasures, but not all treasures are art. His programming doesn't disciminate, forcing Procyon to rise above his hardware limitations.

Too bad he was assigned to explore a region with ZERO artistic potential. Procyon rests atop the church steeple of Coral Town, looking down with disdain upon the dirty streets and even dirtier denizens.

He is equipped with an experimental teleporter, allowing him to jump to anywhere he can see, but he has to rest for a few moments between each jump. He's spent the last day or two carefully exploring the town, getting more and more disgusted with each new discovery.

His appearance is similar to a cannon ball, dark and circular shell with a matte pitted surface. He has managed to avoid being seen so far, and thanks to his translator he's learned of some kind of event happening in the church tonight.

#### Sunday Mass

Procyon teleports to one of the many nooks and crannies along the church ceiling, giving him a good vew of the service. 

Father Wallace has managed to gather several dozen townspeople for some kind of emergency meeting. The Abbot raises his hands, and everyone quiets down. 

"My children! Thank you for coming. It is in these dark times we must cling to one another and stand firm against the forces of darkness! Let us read from..."

After a length sermon, several townsfolk get up to leave and a short fat aristocrat rushes up to the pulpit.

"Thank you, Father, for that rousing encouragement! If I may make a quick announcement." Folks pause and wait to here what the well-dressed man has to say.

"As your Governor, I have watched over you and kept our city safe from a myriad of threats! With God's help, of course. And as his represented authority, I now beg for your help. My daughter, Veronique, has been missing for over a day."

Some murmers spread throughout the church. The Governer lets the tension build, and then announces, "As a demonstration of my thanks, whoever brings her back shall be rewarded 1000 silver! I've no doubt Veronique herself will be extremely grateful as well, immortalizing her hero in one of her talented paintings!"

The people are obviously more moved by the promise of silver, but Procyon perks up at the mention of a painting.

"Please spread the word to any who might be able to find her" the Governor finishes, "before it's too late!" He storms down the aisle and out the door. Most people follow, and Procyon watches the Abbot preach to a near-empty church for the rest of the evening.
