Here's my detailed play report of Planar Compass #1. I used the latest version of Overpowered, my weird solo OSR game.

<base target="_blank">

 - [Planar Compass](https://www.planarcompass.com/planar-compass-zine/planar-compass-issue-1).
 - [Overpowered Rules and Dice App](/overpowered).

*Player notes are in italics. This zine has been on my shelf for a while, and I've been itching to explore the beautiful setting. This is my first time testing Overpowered with a more open-ended adventure, rather than a dungeon crawl. We'll see how it goes.*

#### Intro, The Slipstream Bar

After failing in their previous mission, False.Castor.1 is dredged up from the Astral Sea. After being dried out, repair, and recharged, Castor boots up.

The first thing she sees is a large man with an eyepatch and horns. He's grinning in a slightly smug way. "I knew it!" he cries, and slams his fists down on the table. "I knew you was worth the investment. My smith says you've even got a soul of some kind."

He leans down to look upon Castor's small frame. "You owe me. Big time."

Castor secrets a mist of pheromones directly into the large man's face. 

> Palio One Eye (Onauk): AC 6 [13], HD 4 (15hp), Att 1 × axe (1d8 + 2), THAC0 18 [1], MV 120’ (40’), SV D12 W13 P14 B15 S16 (1), ML 8, AL Chaotic, XP 75, NA 0 (1), TT D

- Spends 1d20, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8 to overcome Palio's Breath Save (B15), and influence him to be more friendly.

The man's grin softens a bit, "You know...somehow I feel like I can trust you." He walks back behind the bar. "Make yourself at home. Tonight I've got a job I could use some help with." And he returns to doing a few chores and tidying up the tavern.

Castor rolls up next to him and extends a small needle, poking in his side. He spins around, and comes face to face with a version of himself.

- Gains 1d12 for sampling a strong creature. Castor uses her Mimic ability to take on Palio's appearance.

He laughs, "Neat trick. You'll be very hand indeed!" Castor spends an hour or two exploring the tavern and scanning items.

- Gains 3d4 for scanning the valuable bottles and drinks. Although there aren't as many as a tavern should have stocked.
- Gains 1d20 for scanning the growler with an astral clipper inside.
- Gains 1d4 for scanning the scrimshaw.
- Gains 1d10 for scanning and sampling everything in this area.

#### The Warehouse

After closing up, Palio leads Castor down a few side streets towards the warehouse. "Oh! Please don't look like me any more. It could confuse some folks." Castor obliges with a soft beep and appears as a normal one-wheeled explorer bot.

He unlocks the door with his key and tells Cator of his troubles. "Someone or something is stealing my goods. I've tried replacing the locks, posting guards, nothing matters. I figure a mechanical soul such as yourself could keep a better eye on this than half-drunk guards. Stay inside and keep watch over the goods. I'll check in on you tomorrow morning."

With that he closes he warehouse door and locks Castor inside. Castor immediately sets about scanning and exploring the large building. 

- Gains 1d8 for entering a new area.
- Gains 1d20 for scanning a small iridescent feather. 

It was located on an out-of-place shelf. After bumping into the shelf, Castor is attacked by 5 Raz! 

> Raz: small vermin with the bodies and tails of rats, the heads of lizards, and the arms and hands of monkeys. AC 7 [12], HD 1/2 (2hp), Att 1 x bite (1d3 + paralysis), THAC0 19 [0], MV 120’ (40’) / 60’ (20’) swimming, SV D12 W13 P14 B15 S16 (1), ML 8, AL Any, XP 5, NA 3d6 (3d10), TT C
