There is a sad goblin part of my brain that always emphasizes "value" whenever I make a purchasing decision.

- "This meal has 20% more food in it for the same price." But do I like this meal as much as the other? Do I actually want 20% more food?
- "If I buy two cans at once I can save $15." I only need one can. If I never use the other one, then it's a total waste.
- "Get this now, you might need it later!" What if I don't need it later? Why shouldn't I just get it later?

That same goblin in my brain sometimes prevents me from finding value in smaller games.

- "Why pay $20 for this 30pg zine when you can get 500 pages of DCC for $40?"
- "Instead of reading this one-page adventure for free, let's buy a compendium for $60 so we have them all!"

And you may have a similar goblin yelling in your own brain when you look at Nate Treme's work.

## Nate Can't Stop Making Games

On his [itch.io store](https://natetreme.itch.io/) Nate has over 40 products available: adventures, spells, NPCs, rules, bestiaries, OSR, lyric games, sci-fi, weird fantasy, steampunk, and everything in between. And that's just on his Itch. As a [long-time Patron](https://www.patreon.com/HPS) of Nate's, he is constantly releasing small, high-quality supplements that regularly impress and inspire me.

The man will not stop making cool shit. 

However, it's easy to listen to the little goblin in your brain and ignore his creations because of their small stature. Many rulebooks and adventures fit on a single page, or even a single business card.

He doesn't make filler, of any kind, for any reason. You JUST get the good stuff. This creative strategy lets Nate completely finish a project and then move on to the next cool idea. He never gets stuck in one place, never stagnates, and continually surprises me with whatever he makes next.

And yet that stupid goblin in my brain struggles to see the value. It would rather have 150 pages of crap and filler than 1 page of genius. 

If only I could kill the goblin in my brain...

## Haunted Almanac Kills the Goblin in Your Brain

Well. That's convenient!

[Games Omnivorous](https://gamesomnivorous.com/) collected a TON of Nate's best work into a big beautiful omnibus.

Within its 200 pages it contains:

- [Tunnel Goons](https://natetreme.itch.io/tunnelgoons) rules + 7 adventures
- [Prole](https://natetreme.itch.io/prole) rules + 2 adventures
- [In the Light of a Ghost Star](https://natetreme.itch.io/itloags)
- 10 one-page RPGs
- 5 micro-settings
- 13 multi-page adventures
- A few misc NPCs, creatures, and spells

For the goblin in your own brain, if you bought all of these things from his itch page indivudually you'd pay **$127**. But Haunted Almanac is just $35.

Now that we've satisfied the goblin in your brain, let's actually take a look at this beautiful book.

## This Beautiful Book

Games Omnivorous (specifically [Guilherme Gontijo](https://www.gontijolab.com/)) is famous for their high quality production, but I think Haunted Almanac stands out even among their impressive catalogue.

Here are some beautiful spreads from the book. Each one feels fresh and unique, like 30 books in one...because it is!

[spreads everywhere]

So...how can I review everything that's in here? It's a LOT of stuff! I don't dare try to cover everything.

Instead I'm going to list ONE thing that I love about every piece; whether it be a single monster, a cool idea, a funny joke, or bit of art. This is not even the best part of each game/adventure/thing, just my personal favorite.

Let's do this!

## Things I Love in No Particular Order

**Tunnel Goons**: Difference between roll and DC is the damage dealt. A genius simplification that keeps the game moving.

**Moldy Unicorn:** This was my first Nate Treme book that I ever read! The barroom encounters are an absolute riot.

**Astral Curse of the Iron Gnomes:** There is an enemy that uses pieces of itself to form minions scattered about. When you kill a minion, it dissolves into a puddle and slowly crawls back to be reabsorbed, leading players right to the monster.

**Eternal Caverns of Urk:** The peoples of Urk table could be used for any weird little village. Example result.

**Up from the Muck:** The primary reward is a marriage alliance.

**The Forgotten Shrine of the Slime Toad:** The most valuable treasure is this weird snot that gets you high. 

**Shrine of the Black Hound:** In a mirror the Pcs see a strange creature following them. If addressed, the being gives them an helpful clue. I also love that the key reward is summoning a great hound that will kill a creature of their choice.

**Viridia's Garden:** A gardening lich is making plantling goblins.

**Prole:** There is a really clever bit of design where the page appears to be transparent, but isn't? Hard to explain, but it's beautiful and striking and I WILL steal it.

**Pilgrims of the Nighted Path:** Candy acts as XP, health, and currency all at the same time. Also it's neat to see kids interacting with truly scary things, rather than just "it was all a dream" nonsense.

**Welcome to Loden:** The "villain" is just a simple miscommunication. Also a skeleton marching band is the big reward.

**In the Light of a Ghost Star:** Exploring a haunted earth using sci-fi rules is really neat and evocative. I also love the character sheet design.

**Radikal Quest:** The class names are \**chefs kiss*\*.

**Automaton:** Reminds me a little of my own game, [Kintsugi](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/kintsugi). We need more goofy robots at our tables.

**Brim & Feather:** DO NOT SPEAK TO THE TREES UNLESS THE SKY IS OVERCAST!

**Mecha Dudes:** You must use these rules with an official D&D adventure that was obtained illegally. HA!

**Snail Knight:** An almost-boardgame with great maps.

**Neanderthal:** Your stats are STR, DEX, FIRE. 

**NOSR:** Instead of HP you track energy, which can be used to cast spells. Kinda like [Troika!](/david/2019/06/troikareview), which I love.

**Wander:** The luck spell can be used to add OR remove luck from a target.

**Smol Business:** The goblin illustration belongs as a tattoo somewhere secret.

**Yeggs:** The font and art of Yeggs really evokes this dirty, British crime drama. Kinda like the movie "Snatch".

**Sequencer:** Another board-gamey idea with a GORGEOUS board design.

**East of East:** The entire adventure is inspired by a quote from The Hobbit. As an aside, I've always wanted to make a game based on this line from Gandalf: "There are many things in the deep waters; and seas and lands may change."

**The Lost Isle:** The Titan Sword is a location in the books. I like to imagine it's the same sword from his newer work, "[Kozmik](https://natetreme.itch.io/kozmik-objects-entities)".

**Doomlands:** 

**Stolen City:** 

**Sweet Bark Island:** 

**Bad Frog Bargain:** 

**Beneath the Mausoleum:** 

**Barrow of the Elf King:** 

**Cursed Chapel of the Sludge Mother:** 

**Death Chemick Gas Station:** 

**Fever Black Mountain:** 

**Lair of the Sad Mage:** 

**Temple of the Bat Serpent:** 

**The Mephitic Laboratory of the Pescamancer:** 

**The Primeval Holt of the Elk Lord:** 

**Thalassic Zigurat of the Lost Prince:** 

**Tomb of the Swine Prophet:** 

**What Child is this?:** 

**Unwanted Magical Companions:** 

**Monster Maker:** 

**Spells of the Inverted Mountain:**
