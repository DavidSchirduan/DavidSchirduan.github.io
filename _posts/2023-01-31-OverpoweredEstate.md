Here's my detailed play report of The Estate. I used the latest version of Overpowered, my weird solo OSR game. The adventure and rules are both free, so you can follow along and try to beat my high score!

### Intro

Lapsang-7 was designed for deep galactic travel, exploration, and excessive displays of force. Her creators were forced to invent entirely new materials to accomodate her massive size. Towering above the tallest buildings, she shone in the night sky for weeks after takeoff.

Now, thousands of years later, she's preparing to touchdown and explore this distant world. Lapsang warms her afterburners and folds into her landing shape as an enormous oblong sphere. The resultant crater is miles wide, massive destructure all around. Hopefully nothing important used to be here.

*Player notes will be in italics. Mausritter is an adorable game of brave mice exploring a large world. The Estate, in particular, is a beautiful adventure that takes common locations and gives an entirely new perspective. Let's see if Lapsang can come to terms with threats even bigger than she is.*
