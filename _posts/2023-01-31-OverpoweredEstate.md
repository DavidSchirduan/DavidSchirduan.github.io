Here's my detailed play report of The Estate. I used the latest version of Overpowered, my weird solo OSR game. The adventure and rules are both free, so you can follow along and try to beat my high score!

### Intro

Lapsang-7 was designed for deep galactic travel, exploration, and excessive displays of force. Her creators were forced to invent entirely new materials to accomodate her massive size. Towering above the tallest buildings, she shone in the night sky for weeks after takeoff.

Now, thousands of years later, she's preparing to touchdown and explore this distant world. Lapsang warms her afterburners and folds into her landing shape as an enormous oblong sphere. The resultant crater is miles wide, massive destruction all around. Hopefully nothing important used to be here.

*Player notes will be in italics. Mausritter is an adorable game of brave mice exploring a large world. The Estate, in particular, is a beautiful adventure that takes common locations and gives an entirely new perspective. Let's see if Lapsang can come to terms with threats even bigger than she is. We rolled a d20 to see where we landed, and will make our way from there.*

#### 19. Mushroom Ring Room 1

Lapsang lands in a mushroom. She should be flashy.

- Gains 1d8 for entering a new area


> 4 Tunnelers rushing around, accusing you of being a spider spy. 8hp, STR 14, DEX 7, WIL 8, Armour 1 Attacks: d8 shovel Critical damage: Carry away in pincers

She unfolds herself and displays a bunch of menacing, flashing, and whirring devices. She overcomes their will.



- Spend d12, d20, d10, d4, d6 to overcome the tunnelers will
- gain 4d6 for weak foes

#### 19. Mushroom Ring Room 2

Big steam room, roller using a silver ladle, and working on the mud balls.
4 frog thieves burst into the door, and one of them darts forward to steal the silver ladle.

- Spends d8, d6, d4, d10, d8, d6, d4 to kill the frog thieves HP. Her violent programming can only be restrained so long. 
- gain 4d6
- spend 1d6 to knock out the roller's HP and take the silver ladle, just out of spite.

By this point the room is empty, everyone is freaked, shoulting about spider invasion. looks a little spidery.

- Gain 2d4 for the silver ladle
- Gain 2d4 for each frog bag of stolen goods (8d4 total)

Now we have 40 Overpower
