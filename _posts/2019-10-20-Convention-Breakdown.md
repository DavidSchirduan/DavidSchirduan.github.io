I've been in a bit of a funk the last few months. But yesterday I attended my first convention as a vendor, and sold my books at a little booth. And it was INVIGORATING!

## Buy Something, Will Ya?!

This was my first convention as a vendor. I have attended 3 other conventions, and had a lot of notes for what I wanted my booth to look like. 

**Vague Goals:**

 - Simple. I only have 3 published books to sell, so I don't need clutter and rising platforms or anything. 
 - Funny. If I don't have one or two puns, then I'm not representing my brand well.
 - Something $5 or less, so people can buy something small.
 - Freebies. To draw people to the booth, and maybe hook them for something bigger.
 - Accept cards. A lot of people carry cash, but I figured it would be good to have a Square account and card reader just in case.

*Our planned setup, about 2-3 days beforehand.*

**Preparation:**
 - [Mythic Mortals](/mythic-mortals) and [Bone Marshes](/bone-marshes) are Print on Demand from Drivethru. I ordered 30 copies of each for about $350. Ouch.
 - [Clink](/clink) was already a print run, and I have about 30 copies laying around the house. (Thanks Ben!)
 - I needed a $5 item. Something small but fun. I hired [Brian Ericson](https://twitter.com/Liefbread) to update [Kintsugi](/david/kintsugi) with a gorgeous pamphlet layout, and a local print shop made 200 of them for $50. I figured I can sell them for like $5.
 - Freebies. For [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) I take 200 word entries and spruce them up with layout and artwork. It didn't feel right to sell them, but they make very pretty freebies. <br> I got 4 different ["explosions"](https://200wordrpg.github.io/patreon) printed on nice cardstock; 100 copies each for $130 total. That gives me 400 freebies to give away. I also decided that you get all FOUR freebies with any purchase. Might motivate people to buy the little $5 item.
 - Signage. My wife has beautiful handwriting and skill with fonts; she made all the gorgeous teasers and signs you see on display.
 - I fit one joke onto my business card, but that's it. This was by far my biggest failing....
 - An extra chair, tablecloth, supplies, and the convention fees came to about $75 total.

*The front of my business card.*

*The back! I think I'm clever.*

All in all I invested almost $600 on this convention setup and I was TERRIFIED! This is the biggest financial risk I've taken in my publishing career. Hopefully I can sell everything over the course of 3-4 conventions over the next few years. Or I can take them to some local bookstores. 

Still though....I didn't sleep much the night before the convention started.

## How did it go?

**It was a blast.** The dynamic of a convention floor is way more laidback than a flea market or shopping mall. I don't have to yell at people or harass them. I just sit back, and if someone is interested they'll look at my stuff, approach the booth, and I'll offer them a freebie to get the conversation started. I found it very comfortable and easy; but then again I'm also a very outgoing person. Your mileage may vary.

This was a new convention, in a small area, but the crowds were steady and had some decent foot traffic. I was there from 10am to 5pm on a rainy saturday. 

Some notable interactions:
 - "I've always wanted to play D&D but never tried it. I think I'll pick up the starter set tonight!" _She walks away without buying anything._
 - _While explaining my books to someone else I jokingly said that he'll probably want all three of my books for the full experience._ "Okay, I'll take all three." _My jaw drops._
 - One guy took a freebie but didn't seem very interested. He came back 2 hours later and bought one of my books after showing the freebie to his kids.
 - _One girl bought a book just for the art. I tried to explain the game, but she had no interest in it; just liked the art._ "I'm gonna cut these and put them in my collage."

*The day of the convention! Sorry for the blur, I'm bad at phones.*

I didn't really pick up a pattern; some people had heard of D&D and wanted to try something like it, others already play, and still others just thought the idea of a storytelling game sounded novel. I wish I had a better handle on how to appeal to the audience the convention brought in.

**Some numbers:**

 - 25ish people took my business card without any other kind of engagement. 
 - I probably gave away 100 freebies, including the ones packaged with purchases.
 - I sold about 15 books.

## Lessons Learned

- "Do you play DND?" should be there. I spent a lot of time explaining RPGs. I worry it might turn people away, but they probably wouldn't be interested anyway?? I dunno. Still thinking.
 - Clarify my pitch. By the end of the day I had it down pat, but the first few hours I stumbled over my words and said something different every time. Next time I'll have something memorized.
 - Less words on the table. I saw a lot of people's eyes glaze over. The intention was to have the book pitches written down, but maybe I should have the books on the stands, and the descriptions underneath or something.
 - Change wording of the freebies. "5 games for $5" instead of "Buy the $5 pamphlet and get the 4 freebies with it." Or something...
 - I brought WAY too many books with me. I brought my whole stock, which was like 3 heavy boxes. But I only sold about 5 copies of each book. Going to seriously tone it down next time.

All in all, I'm very happy with how things went. I made back about half of my costs. One more convention like this, and I'll have broken even; then all sales are profit going forward. 

More importantly, that experience gave me a much needed boost to my publisher brain. _Begin personal ramble..._

## Little Baby David

For a long time video games were my primary joy and escape from reality. I wasn't a depressed kid, but not a lot of activities interested me. And I tried a bunch. I played Trombone for 3 years, Tennis for 5, Soccer for 2, took a drawing class, wrote a few short stories, and even considered writing a poem once. 

![convention_trumpet.jpg](/images/posts/convention_trumpet.jpg)
*I never did get the hang of the trombone....*

I accepted the fact that I simply wasn't a creative person, and took solace in the world of video games and my church community. 

But then I played D&D. It was kind of a mediocre experience until our GM left and the group wanted me to be try being the GM. 

I flourished. 

It wasn't long after that I started making my own game and publishing them. It's been about 4 years since my first [REAL game](/mythic-mortals) came out, and I'm addicted to this little hobby. 

However 99% of all my gaming interactions have been online. My town is probably the nerdiest city in the entire state, but it still only has 2 brick and mortar gaming stores. 

I always felt left behind when I saw pictures of convention booths, heard panel recordings, and listened to stories about incredible con experiences. It's always been a dream of mine to sell my game at a big convention, to be "legit". Not like an obsessive goal or anything, but always something that lurked in the back of my mind.

There's been a dissatisfaction growing within me about my online interactions. I know people enjoy my games and buy them, but I don't hear about it. Not often enough. Add to that the stress of running the [200 Word RPG challenge](https://200wordrpg.github.io/), and I've been in a bit of a funk for the past few months. 

Well, this year we had TWO brand new conventions come to charleston, and a few others have really grown in popularity.

My time has come.

Seeing people handle my books, flip through them and get excited; it was nice. I need more of that. I signed up for another convention in November, and one in February. I can't wait to improve my booth and add Lowcountry Crawl to my table.

Conventions aren't for everyone, but for me, it's been an exciting adventure that I feel I've only just begun. Maybe I'll see you at the next one!

_But if not I also sell my stuff online! Clink and Kintsugi print copies are FINALLY available for purchase again. [BUY SOMETHING WILL YA](/games)?!_
