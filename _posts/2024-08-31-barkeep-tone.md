This is superficially a review of Barkeep on the Borderlands. But everyone knows it's good. It won a bunch of awards, it's written by a killer team, and the book is absolutely gorgeous. So we'll get the review portion out of the way first.

I ran a game of Barkeep for 4 sessions. We entered less than half of the bars, and only made it to the end of day 2 (of 6). We could have played it for another 4-8 sessions but scheduling got difficult.

- Did we have deep character moments? A few. 
- Did we explore strange places and loot awesome items? Yeah, a bit.
- Did we laugh? So hard that I had to take regular breaks.

I can, without a doubt, say is the most I have ever laughed during any RPG campaign. Of course most of the credit goes to my very good friends who made the most of every situation. But the books provided a very solid foundation of silliness and hilarity that cannot be understated (more on that later).

A+. A unique concept excecuted beautifully.

5 stars. The art and writing are superb.

9/10, because I think the drinking mechanics are a tad clunky. Everything else is perfect.

## So What is This REALLY About?

In my [Cloud Empress Review]({% post_url 2024-08-07-cloud-empress-review %}) I said the tone of the game was something that engaged me and my players:

> But more than that it was...melancholy. Not in a grimdark or maudlin kind of way. More like an old man refusing to tell a painful story. 

And again with Barkeep, that consistent tone reinforced the writing to help put my players in the right mindset. It was like having constant stage direction from the authors.

So this article is really about setting a tone in TTRPGs. I'm going to compare Cloud Empress, Barkeep, and a few others to pin down how they set such a strong tone. 

## Some of My Favorite Examples

Before we take a look at Barkeep, I want to drop a few quick examples to demonstrate how tone can be affected by writing, mechanics, art, etc. **I firmly believe that the tone communicated by an RPG author is inteded to be replicated by the GM.** So while you could run Mothership as a comedy game [(which I have)]({% post_url 2022-09-03-KarthLoveMothership %}) I don't think that's a reflection of the games tone. 

First up, **Cloud Empress**. It uses horror game mechanics to drive tension and make the players feel that this world is dangerous. Even the mysterious chalk that powers your magic and gadgets is poisonous. Your character knows the spell "Lightning Blade"? I hope they never have to use it.

> In truth, chalk is a pollutant. It sits heavy in the soil, creeping into the grass and the crops, and settling in the bones of deer-dogs and humans alike. Chalk crawls up the food chain, bleaching skeletons and withering bodies, before finding its way to the apex, to the Imago. Magic lives in the teeth. Frightened caregivers pull their children's wisdom teeth young, cutting off magic at its roots. Each spell has a cost. All things in life have a cost. With every pleasure there is pain. The spell’s price is paid in full as soon as its effect has ended. You might be done with the spell, but the spell isn’t done with you, not by a long shot. -- from the free Cloud Empress rulebook

Most locations have a strong tension between the different factions. The only peaceful places are the uninhabited ones.

> A single house sits on a sandy hill, a skull painted on the door. An old woman, Worm, welcomes most visitors. Her hands tremble uncontrollably as she attempts to prepare tea. She seems confused, and any frustration quickly turns to violence. Worm feels no pain, her entire body having been taken over by the white fungus. Each digit, joint, and limb functions autonomously and must be destroyed separately to end the fight. Worm’s wounds expel a white dust and any severed fingers try to crawl into mouths and implant the infection. The Hounds’ Incense Burner (pg. 55) sits on a bookshelf near
the kitchen. -- from the Land of Cicadas

There is hope and beauty, but it has to be carefully extracted from a dangerous place. The mechanics, writing, and setting details all come together to drive home a strong tone. 

As a GM, this tone was easy to replicate and fall back on. I had little rules in my head:

- There is always a danger, probably unseen.
- Every benefit has a cost.
- People are hurting but hopeful.
- The Imago are unknowable.
- Soldiers are bastards.

The book taught me those lessons, and I carried that forward to the players.

Let's contrast this with an equally dangerous setting with a drastically different tone: [**Magical Murder Mansion**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/276115/Magical-Murder-Mansion).

You can read [my review here](/david/2019/09/MurderMansion), but I'd argue the primary tone of this adventure is set by the author himself during the introduction:

> Some of the traps in classic funhouse dungeons seem like jokes designed for the module’s author and the GM to share, with the poor players left frustrated and baffled. I’ve tried to make Magical Murder Mansion entertaining for everyone; even the deathtraps and surprises should get an joyful “oh no, I can’t believe we walked into that one” from the players. The GM knows it’s a trap. The players know it’s a trap. But someone’s got to open that door. -- Skerples introducting the adventure

Without that introduction I think the humor would take a little longer to emerge from the book. "Wait...is he serious?" would get asked a few times before the group finally realizes that this is supposed to be silly.

Some rooms actually are filled with jokes (like a stuffed lion with "not a mimic" scrawled on it), and some rooms are just outrageous death traps. And while the characters are probably suffering horribly, the players are likely chuckling along with each damage roll.

I also think a big part of the humor comes from a familiarity with dungeon crawls. If this was someone's first dungeon crawl they might not get some of the jokes. 

But Magical Murder Mansion successfully uses subtle clues to provide an undercurrent of humor in the middle of a diabolical deathtrap adventure.

For a more personal example of how a games tone can be influenced by its parts, I will take a quick look at [**Bones Deep**](/bones-deep).

Bones Deep has some grim elements that were very strong in the early drafts. You had cursed wizard rivalries, creepy underwater monsters, and skeleton body horror. Even the Crab Cabal were much more nefarious (with far crueler punishments for going into too much debt).

However we really struggled with the "miens" of each creature. In Troika every creature has 6 potential "miens" or moods or temperments. I couldn't get them right; either they felt too boring ("angry", "sad", "hungry") or they were too confusing ("filled with revenge"). I ended up reaching out to [Evey Lockheart](https://violentmedia.itch.io/), who is a brilliant Troika wizard. 

She took each of our creatures and spiced them up with some of the most engaging, creative, and silly miens I've ever seen. While she wrote less than 2% of the book, her contributions brought a massive amount of levity and life to each creature. Each mien impacts the scenarios during play. I credit Evey with a big chunk of what makes Bones Deep such a fun and appealing adventure for people to play.

Sometimes the tone can be affected by the smallest details of an adventure.

## What About Barkeep?

So we've looked at a book where the tone is repeated by its art, its writing, and its content. We looked at a book where the tone is subtly growing stronger throughout the adventure. And we saw how a small part of a book can drastically impact its final tone.

Barkeep repeats all three of these strategies, a truly great accomplishment with 12 writers and 3 editors! It must have been a significant challenge to keep everyone on the same page with the same goals. 

Comedy adventure modules are somewhat common, but I've never read one that succeeds so brilliantly in making the entire group laugh constantly. 

2 secrets:

1) cartoonish drinking (alcohol is kind of serious, at least for me. I was hesitant that barkeep might be beliggerant or ugly)
2) low stakes (death can happen, but it's not the focus. Blackout is another lose condition)
3) engaging scenarios (less like a cutscene and more like being brought into a bit during improv)
