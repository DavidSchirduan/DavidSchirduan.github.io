## Mothership Didn't Click with Me

The [Mothership RPG](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/) has been an indie darling for a while now. It's known as being rules-light horror game that removes JUST enough player agency to keep tensions high. Arguably Mothership is better known for the incredibly well-presented adventures that pack 200 pages of content into a 30pg zine.

I avoided Mothership because I don't like horror; neither do most of my players. A lot of horror games just don't seem...fun? If the game fails to be scary (which it will if I GM it), then there's nothing else there for players to latch on to. "Your character dies in some horrific way. Congrats?"

I played Mothership a few years back with a group of friends. We enjoyed the character creation and the start of the adventure, but the game fell apart very quickly. My players often failed their rolls, they didn't get very far into the adventure, death was swift, and I didn't understand how to run the game. We gave up after an hour. Since then I've enjoyed reading their adventure, stealing some layout ideas, and seeing the vibrant community that's risen around the game.

But it definitely wasn't for me.

Fast forward to a few months ago. I saw the [Mothership Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gerdling/mothership-sci-fi-horror-rpg-1st-edition-boxed-set) make big waves and blast through stretch goal after stretch goal. I also heard they were finally publishing a GM guide and my interest was piqued. 

"What had I done wrong last time? What key info was I missing? SO many people enjoy this, there must be a secret."

I backed the Kickstarter and resolved to run a game ASAP. Around the same time my friend asked me to run an 8-hour RPG session for his bachelor party, and I decided to try out Mothership and crack the code. However I still don't particularly enjoy horror, and the bachelor requested a more action-oriented gaming session. 

I already owned copies of [Pound of Flesh](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/a-pound-of-flesh) and [Dead Planet](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/dead-planet). But I needed a Mothership adventure that didn't take itself too seriously. 

Enter [Desert Moon of Karth](https://shop.tuesdayknightgames.com/products/the-desert-moon-of-karth).

## Karth is Beautiful

I grabbed Desert Moon of Karth because I needed one more product to qualify for free shipping from [Exalted Funeral](https://www.exaltedfuneral.com/) and the cover art sold me. It reminded me of my own game, [Clink](/clink), and I'm a sucker for westerns.

As it turns out, Karth not only provides a fresh and exciting sci-fi romp, it was also the secret ingredient I needed to unlock Mothership. First, some details about Karth:

- 52 pages
- 10 Locations
- 20+ Random Encounters
- A dozen NPCs
- 3 Dungeons
- TONS of flavorful tables and tidbits

As a bulleted list you might think, "Hmmm, not bad. Not bad at all." But you wouldn't really understand the true value of this book.

Karth oozes charm. Every location has depth. Every NPC is nuanced or weird. Random encounters draw you deeper into the factions and encourage you to visit other locations. Every page has a dozen ideas to fuel your GM inspiration.

I'll repeat myself again: There is a sweet spot for how much information the GM needs to run a game. Too much info and the GM has to cut out the cruft and take a bunch of notes. Too little info and the GM is making it up anyway, so why buy the adventure?

Karth really nails that sweet spot with a mixture of familiar cliches to keep everyone on the same page sprinkled in with unexpected weirdness.

For example, the image above lists 10 different buildings in the city. But notice how each building contains a kind of depth that draws you in

- **The Medical Clinic** is run by an unsettling android doctor. He's also the only one who can refine valuable materials, so players will end up visiting him either way.
- **The Desperado Karoke Bar** is the perfect place to learn some rumors, but it's hardly a relaxing place. Music, dancing, and drinking set it apart from the cliched dusty saloon.
- **The General Store Emporium** is run by a friendly woman who smells of lilac and keeps a shutgun under the counter. A bunch of her wares are non-functional, but she doesn't know that and will be quick to offer a refund or apologize.

And that's just from ONE of the locations in the book. Everything has this unique blend of familiar tropes and fresh, unexpected ideas that make it easy to run on the fly.

And on top of all that, it's funny. I mean, it's REALLY funny. Humor can be difficult in RPGs, but what makes Karth so special is that the rules act as the straight man while the adventure is making funny faces in the background. It's often dark humor, of course, and with the proper tone a lot of these jokes will just come off as creepy.

For example: At an isolated farmhouse there is a woman who will rent the players some mounts. Her husband is frozen in a cryo chamber, but she talks to him like he's still conscious. Secretly, she hopes he never wakes up.

- **Funny:** "Gerald! Please speak up, we have guests. I swear that man couldn't make himself heard if he were dying!"
- **Creepy:** "Oh dear, I don't think Gerald likes you very much. If you upset him, I'll have to get my knives..."

It's rare to see something so flexible in an RPG product. Of course, for the bachelor party, everything was very goofy and light-hearted.

## The Secret to Mothership

Here are three things I was doing wrong when I played Mothership the first time, as well as how I improved my game:

1. **Find the right adventure.** This can seem obvious, but when the creators of Mothership release an adventure module, I assumed that THIS was the intended experience. I applaud Mothership and other indie games for embracing the third-party community and expanding what a gaming experience can be.

2. **Panic Often.** Despite my fears, the Panic Check was really fun. There's a funny dynamic where players obviously don't like having to make a panic check...but at the same time they lean forward and hold their breath while I look up the result. It was a really healthy tension that can drive home more consequences than just "you take damage". When the game gets slow or tension wanes, introduce something new to the game and call for a panic check. See the 4-armed duelist for a good example further down.

3. **Keep Combat Simple.** When I first played Mothership I ran combat like other games; enemies take turns and deal damage, players take turns and deal damage, etc. But that is not only dull, it will kill your players VERY quickly. Instead simply describe what will happen if the players do nothing. Then give each player a turn to try and prevent that outcome. I'll give an example for this one:

> GM: "The sandsquid charges towards you. It will eat Bieffe, and rip your speeder in half. What do you do?"

Then the players can each take a turn in any order to try and prevent that. "I shoot it in the eyes as someone else swings the skiff to the side." This keeps combat from just being damage back and forth, encouraging players to find solutions rather than just die rolls. It also means that ~~if~~ when they fail the consequences can be severe; you hardly need damage rolls, just describe what happens.

## The Legend of Bieffe

To drive the point home, here's a summary of our play session. Everyone had a good time, and we hope we can meet up again to continue our tale.

We had 4 players, one of whom had never played an RPG before.

- **Bieffe**. A teamster with a strange accent who liked shiny things and industrial equipment.
- **Monte**. An android who served as the personal calculator to a big corp. He fudged the numbers and is on the run.
- **Aleos**. A marine who left the govt and is looking for new life as a merc.
- **Egon**. A scientist who specialized in botony, specifically spores, molds, and fungus. (As an aside, I think playing a known character is a GREAT way to start roleplaying. I welcomed this!)

All four characters want to get away from the Imperium, so they hire Captain Kelly to transport them "anywhere far from here and potentially profitable." Kelly agrees and thinks Karth will be the perfect destination. "There's a bit of a gold rush happening there", Kelly explains, "And I bet together we can all make a little money."

The players are put into cryo sleep and the ship leaves for its 6 month journey.

5 years later, the characters awaken from cryo and are met with a battered Captain Kelly. He's been through hell and is missing an arm. "That's not all", Kelly explains, "We crashed on this miserable rock and a sandsquid ate my special medallion! Without that medallion we'll never be able to leave the planet."

He walks the players outside to show them the wreck and the surrounding desert. He picks up an old gas tank and lights the bottom. The tank launches into the air. When it reaches 600' in the air a laser beam comes out of nowhere and blows it up.

"If we don't get that medallion back, we'll be here forever. Hopefully y'all are more successful than my last batch of assistants." Kelly gestures towards the cargo hold of half-empty cryo pods. "Here's a few credits. Go into town and get supplies. When you return, we'll hunt that old squid down and get off this rock."

Monte and Aleos search through the ship and discover some unused speeder bikes lying in the corner. They can't ride them for fear of attracting sandsquid, but they dismantle the bikes for parts and hope to sell them. Egon and Bieffe are eager to get started, and they begin their trek through the mountains towards town.

On the slopes of the shallow mountain range they discover the wreck of an old shipwreck. 

- Bieffe opens a container to discover some kind of strange tracking device.
- Egon uncovers a tub of toxic waste.
- Aleos finds an unpowered mech suit too heavy to carry.
- Monte discovers and activates a strange-looking drone which immediately begins firing on the group.

After a Panic Check when the drone goes invisible, the group comes up with a plan. Egon with throw the toxic waste on the drone to expose its circuits, Monte will hack the drone to disable it, while Aleos and Bieffe prepare to shoot it if all else fails.

- Egon succeeds, exposing some wiring in the drone. 
- Monte fails to hack the drone AND fails his second Panic Check. He's terrified and attempts to flee the battle.
