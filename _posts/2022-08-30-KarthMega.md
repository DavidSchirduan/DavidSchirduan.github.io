## Mothership Made No Sense, at First

The [Mothership RPG](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/) has been an indie darling for a while now. It's known as being rules-light horror that removes JUST enough player agency to keep tensions high. Arguably Mothership is better known for the incredibly well-presented adventures that pack 200 pages of content into a 30pg zine.

I avoided Mothership because I don't like horror; neither do most of my players. A lot of horror games just don't seem...fun? If the game fails to be scary (which it will if I GM it), then there's nothing else there for players to latch on to.

I played Mothership a few years back with a group of friends. We enjoyed the character creation, but the game fell apart very quickly. My players often failed their rolls, they didn't get very far into the adventure, death was swift, and I didn't understand how to run the game. 

I figured it was a lost cause and moved it to the "whatever" folder of my Google Drive. Since then I've enjoyed most of the adventures and stolen the occasional idea or two for my own games. But Mothership in general was a dud.

Fast forward to a few months ago. I saw the [Mothership Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gerdling/mothership-sci-fi-horror-rpg-1st-edition-boxed-set) make big waves and blast through stretch goal after stretch goal. I also heard they were finally publishing a GM guide and my interest was piqued. 

"What had I done wrong last time? What key info was I missing?"

I backed the Kickstarter and resolved to run a game ASAP. My friend asked me to run an 8-hour RPG session for his bachelor party, and I was determined to try out Mothership and crack the code.

However I still don't particularly enjoy horror, and the bachelor requested a more light-hearted gaming session. I searched for a Mothership adventure that didn't take itself too seriously.

Enter [Desert Moon of Karth](https://shop.tuesdayknightgames.com/products/the-desert-moon-of-karth).

## Desert Moon of Karth

I grabbed Desert Moon of Karth because I ordered a bunch of stuff from [Exalted Funeral](https://www.exaltedfuneral.com/) and the cover art sold me. When I learned it was based on the Mothership system my heart fell and I shoved it into my library shelves and forgot about it.

Later, as I began to learn the rules for Mothership, I remembered my copy of Karth and dusted it off with hopeful hands. 

As it turns out, Karth not only provides a fresh and exciting sci-fi romp, it was also the secret ingredient I needed to unlock Mothership.

First, some details about Karth:

- 52 pages
- 10 Locations
- 20+ Random Encounters
- A dozen NPCs
- 3 Dungeons
- TONS of flavorful tables and tidbits

As a bulleted list you might think, "Hmmm, not bad. Not bad at all." But you wouldn't really understand the true value of this book.

Karth oozes charm. Every location has depth. Every NPC is nuanced or weird. Random encounters draw you deeper into the factions and encourage you to visit other locations. Every page has a dozen ideas to fuel your GM inspiration.

For example, the image above lists 10 different buildings in the city. But notice how each building contains a kind of depth that draws you in

And that's just from ONE of the locations in the book. 

And on top of all that, it's funny. I mean, it's REALLY funny. Humor can be difficult in RPGs, but what makes Karth so special is that the rules act as the straight man while the adventure is making funny faces in the background.

- example funny (women with husband in cryo)
- example funny (the raiders worshipping doom)
- example funny 

All of these things COULD be presented in a gritty/serious tone, but I feel that they offer a great contrast to the dry and horrific rules of Mothership.

## How Karth Taught me to Love Mothership

Karth taught me how to make Panic Checks fun, and the new GM guide taught me how to run combat. These two bits of knowledge helped me unlock the game and have a blast with Mothership.

First, the Panic Check. Characters accumulate **Stress** as they fail rolls or get injured. 2 Stress is the minimum, 15 Stress is a LOT.

Whenever the players encounter something particularly scary or upsetting they must make a Panic Check. They grab that big d20 and try to roll it above their current Stress. The more stress, the harder the roll. If they fail that roll there is a big table of bad things that happen (even more stress, gain negative conditions, freak out other players, etc).

However when I first read this rule I thought it sounded terrible. "So I just decide when the players panic? They don't have any control over this? This makes me feel like a bully."

And when I first played Mothership, I only called for one or two panic rolls the entire session. Because the game was already dreary and miserable, I didn't want to add any more grief to the game.

- panic checks allowed characters to fear without players
- they offer an in-between option for the GM
- They're fun! for everyone!

As for combat, when I first played it I ran it like a normal RPG; enemies take turns, players take turns, etc.

But the secret all along was to simply describe what will happen and give players each a turn to stop it. Simple and powerful.

Now that I know how to enjoy Mothership, here's how our game went!

## The Legend of Bieffe

Hired Kelly, put in cryo
Wake up 5 years later, Kelly is a drunk wreck
Dismantle old speeder bikes to sell
Head into town for supplies
Mountain pass crashed ship, fight with drone
Avoided coraldust traders
In town pistol duel, they get involved, secret 4 arm reveal 0anic check
They spare him, and Marshall owes him a favor

Party, drink, sleep, meet fayed
At night see hagfish guy, confrint him, investigate.
Bump into henchmen, get escorted to tanks, yell to fayed, fight, marshall arrives
Next morning
Marshall will sell minigun, but no speeder
Meet general store, sell bike parts
Get enough money to buy gun and speeder.
Drive back to Kelly, bunch of panic checks

Fire the gun, fire harpoon, Kelly drunk, 
drove speeder into mouth, explode, land I. Heart
Dylan grabbed and eaten, land in stomach
Sandswuid skilled, medallion found.
They take over the shop, and Kelly is cremate now.
They have an excellent business opportunity.
