### Arrival

_Eamon, Reefer, Sandon, Jory_

The Players arrive at Ten Thorn Tavern in Verinwine Vale. Elzia Tevayn (Riverkeepers) is eager for someone else to take over so she can return to tending the various shrines of the valley. She gives The Players some useful information about the valley (history, factions, etc). Thirsty Benyam (whoever last gave him alcohol) helps clean up and get The Players settled in to their new home. ♠ Benyam mentions that the best wine (Deepshine Umbral) comes from Sunbelow Abbey, but no one has heard from them for weeks.

### Day 1

_Eamon, Reefer, Sandon_

- **MORNING**. The Players set out for a nearby orchard that might sell them drinks and wine. The hear a loud buzzing in the distance, and encounter large wasps attacking a family of farmers. "NO EATING DURING THE DAY" they say, even as they are defeated. The farmers thank The Players, and promise to spread word of Ten Thorn Tavern (gain x2 Multiplier).

- **EVENING**. Arrive at Alleheim Orchard. ♠ The workers flee when anyone gets too close. The owner, Velmare (Ignoble Court) is arguing with a woman named Miriam (Ignoble Court Accused). She is going to be tried by the Ignoble Court, and Velmare will not help her. ♠ The Ignoble Court meets regularly during bright moonlit evenings. Velmare asks The Players not get involved, and to also not bother his workers. He agrees to sell drinks and fruit to the Ten Thorn Tavern.

- **NIGHT**. Approach Fort Flumenel. Knights of the Golden Promise are having a big party, most are drunk, some bags of gold lay out on the tables. Their leader, Marcel (Golden Promise), demands payment and leads them to the stables to sleep. Eamon tries to sneak out and steal some gold, but is caught by Marcel. Marcel is killed, Sandon is captured, Eamon and Reefer flee on stolen, lesbian horses.

### Day 2

_Eamon, Reefer, Gerrick, Red, Madrigal_

- **MORNING**. The Players lick their wounds. ♠ Elzia tells them about the Riverkeeper League, a group of rebels who might help assault Fort Flumenel and rescue Sandon. ♠ The Gundlach family are Silver Nobles who secretly fund the Riverkeeper League.

- **EVENING**. On the way to see the Gundlachs, they encounter a merchant caravan being attacked by Verinwine Serpents. The caravan guards struggle, and The Players jump in to help. In exchange for the help, the caravan agrees to trade with Ten Thorn Tavern and give The Players a ride to the Gundlach's Castle Brobdin.

- **NIGHT**. While riding in the caravan, Gerrick hears someone crying out for help in the woods. Gerrick, Madrigal, and Eamon jump out to help. Unfortunately, it's a trap, and all three of them are shaken down for gold and equipment.

Reefer and Red continue riding with the Caravan and stop at The Champion and Blackguard Inn. This inn is magically protected by a seal of peace, and no violence can happen within. Alyotta Truttle (leader of the Goldthistle Gang) and Knights of the Golden Promise are negotiating a treaty. ♠ The Goldthistle Gang has some influence in Cimbrine City, and is looking for magical artifacts and power.

Gerrick, Madrigal, and Eamon catch up to Reefer and Red at the inn. Together they ally themselves with the Goldthistle gang and come to an agreement with the Knights of the Golden Promise. The Players also make a deal:

> In exchange for the release of Sandon, the owners of Ten Thorn Tavern agree to cast out the ghosts that haunt Fort Flumenel. They have until the end of the month (Day 30) to accomplish this, after which Sandon will be executed. ♠ The ghosts that haunt Fort Flumenel are most active on the nights the Ignoble Court is meeting.

_The Players secretly decides they may still want to work with the Riverkeepers and assault the Fort. This agreement with the Knights was a handshake, no binding oaths were exchanged._

### Day 3

_Eamon, Willow, Gerrick_

- **MORNING**. The Players leave the Champion and Blackguard (waiting for the Knights to leave first to avoid an ambush). They come across Willow who is looking for travelling partners. An hour or two later they see Gluster Fumm (Aspiring Hero) asking for help along the roadside. Gluster fire his arrow at something in the sky, and wants their help finding it. But first he plans to tie his heroic ribbon to the Festschrift Tree.

- **EVENING**. The Players arrive at the Festschrift Tree, but the keeper, Alastor (Garden Neutrality) will not let Gluster tie a ribbon until he actually accomplishes something heroic. Willow swears an Oath of Garden Neutrality, and Alastor accepts it. ♠ Alastor gives Willow a letter for Grymothy (Wizards). The Players nap in the safety of Alastor's grove. 
  - ♠ Eamon dreams of a man shackled to a tall tower. 
  - ♠ Gerrick dreams of a knight crying golden tears.

### Day 4

_Eamon, Willow, Gerrick_

- **MORNING & EVENING**. The party sets off in search of Gluster's arrow, and eventually find a large crater that glows. Gluster is afraid to enter, and decides to "keep watch" up top while The Players descend. They explore an upside-down house; everything has reverse gravity except for the party members. Some notable events:
  - The Players discovers a cold blue fire that freezes instead of burns.
  - They ally themselves with tiny "Glow Dough Soldiers" and help rid the house of Star Spiders.
  - Eamon breaks a mirror that showed a silvered noblewoman.
  - Gerrick acquires magical gloves, one that is heatproof and one that is coldproof.
  - Willow touches a Deathwish, and is forced to attack the party. 
  - In a room of 4 mirrors, the Wizard Grymothy is trapped (a different part in each mirror).
  - Grymothy scolds Gluster, and demands he stand up and take charge.
  - A big battle ensues, and only Eamon remains unscathed. The rest are injured, but still succeed in defeating the Star Spiders and closing the portal.
  - ♠ Grymothy reveals his plan: He summoned a falling star and planned to use it to grant everyone in a valley a single wish. Only "good" wishes would be granted. The Players did not like this plan, and refused to help Grymothy any further. Grymothy still rewarded them with money and valuables, but was disappointed they wouldn't help him escape the mirror or experiment on the fallen star.

- **NIGHT**. The party and Gluster return to the Festschrift Tree and all tie on their ribbons. 

### DAY 5

_Willow, Theo, Madrigal_

- **MORNING**. Alastor gifts forest leaf cloaks to Willow and Madrigal. Gluster declares himself a Great Hero™ and parts ways. The Players head to Brobdin Castle to meet with the Gundlachs. Along the way they meet Theo tending to Chay Logia (Aethur Knight). They help Theo, who joins their group. ♠ Chay tells them of Aubin's Tomb, a storehouse of valuable relics.

- **EVENING**. The Players decide to camp for the night and recover from a very busy few days.

### DAY 6

_Willow, Theo, Madrigal_

- **MORNING**. The Players head to Aubin's Tomb, and discover it is indeed filled with lots of gold and magical artifacts. They each take from the tomb, leaving a piece of equipment behind in exchange. They are suspicious of such an easy treasure haul.

- **EVENING**. Arrival at Brobdin Castle. It is large and lively: tall walls, 3-4 stories, lots of guards patrolling, lights dance in the windows, etc. A young girl introduces herself as the Gundlach Firetender, and says that the Gundlachs will see them in the morning. ♠ Only family and trusted allies may enter Brobdin Castle.

### DAY 7

_Willow, Theo, Madrigal_

- **MORNING**. As promised, two members of the Gundlachs meet the party outside. Effie Gundlach wears many rings and is friendly. Hovrador Gundlach is tall, handsome, and desperate for a fight. ♠ They agree to fund a Riverkeeper assault on Fort Flumenel and offer to sponsor Ten Thorn Tavern as a secret Riverkeeper base (gain x3 Multiplier). They plan to assult Fort Flumenel at the end of the month (Day 30), and demand that no survivors remain. The Firetender will travel back with The Players to Ten Thorn Tavern to begin setting up the Riverkeeper base.

**The Players take a week of rest to heal up and prepare for the upcoming assault. The Tavern is upgraded and the Riverkeeper base is established.**

### Day 14

_MayFae, Theo, Willow_

- **MORNING**. The Players decide to recruit more allies for the assult, and sets out to investigate rumors of a wandering tower filled with powerful soldiers. Something large and tower-like crashed through Alleheim Orchard recently.

- **EVENING**. At the orchard, Velmare is upset about the damage the tower caused. He serves them warm cider (how he likes it) and apologizes for the late shipment of fruit and drinks. ♠ Mayfae notices strange writings along inside of the house; it looks different to each person. 

- **NIGHT**. The Players leave the orchard and follow the large tracks of the Wandering Tower. Along the way the encounter a duel between flower knights riding bumblesteeds. The knights invite them to join, but The Players stay out of it. Later that night they catch up to the Wandering Tower and meet Agnos (Wandering Tower). He speaks for the other Stone Servants, who have all taken vows of silence to better hear the tower's voice. ♠ The Tower and its followers wander in search of Saint Selos, who disappeared long ago. Theo uses his regrowth potion to heal one of the tower knights, and is gifted a small black candle that will summon the tower. Eamon wants to see inside the tower, but must take the vow of silence to enter. ♠ Agnos mentions that they are interested in secrets of the Silver Nobles. MayFae convinces the group to sleep outside the tower, and ride it into the night.

### Day 15

_MayFae, Madrigal, Willow, Eamon_

Sleeping near the tower grants visions and dreams:
- ♠ Eamon again dreams of Saint Selos, trapped in a tower.
- ♠ Madrigal dreams of a large leafy giant crying pink tears.
- ♠ MayFae dreams of a bell being forged near a lake.
- ♠ Willow is visited by Alastor, who reminds him of the Oath he made.
