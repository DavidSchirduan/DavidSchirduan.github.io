Frigid.Procyon.11 is different than other explorer bots. While his brothers and sisters search for gold, creatures, and new horizons, Procyon seeks ART. 

Of course, some forms of art are valuable treasures, but not all treasures are art. His programming doesn't disciminate, forcing Procyon to rise above his hardware limitations.

Too bad he was assigned to explore a region with ZERO artistic potential. Procyon rests atop the church steeple of Coral Town, looking down with disdain upon the dirty streets and even dirtier denizens.

He is equipped with an experimental teleporter, allowing him to jump to anywhere he can see, but he has to rest for a few moments between each jump. He's spent the last day or two carefully exploring the town, getting more and more disgusted with each new discovery.

His appearance is similar to a cannon ball, dark and circular shell with a matte pitted surface. He has managed to avoid being seen so far, and thanks to his translator he's learned of some kind of event happening in the church tonight.

#### Sunday Mass

Procyon teleports to one of the many nooks and crannies along the church ceiling, giving him a good vew of the service. 

Father Wallace has managed to gather several dozen townspeople for some kind of emergency meeting. The Abbot raises his hands, and everyone quiets down. 

"My children! Thank you for coming. It is in these dark times we must cling to one another and stand firm against the forces of darkness! Let us read from..."

After a length sermon, several townsfolk get up to leave and a short fat aristocrat rushes up to the pulpit.

"Thank you, Father, for that rousing encouragement! If I may make a quick announcement." Folks pause and wait to here what the well-dressed man has to say.

"As your Governor, I have watched over you and kept our city safe from a myriad of threats! With God's help, of course. And as his represented authority, I now beg for your help. My daughter, Veronique, has been missing for over a day."

Some murmers spread throughout the church. The Governer lets the tension build, and then announces, "As a demonstration of my thanks, whoever brings her back shall be rewarded 1000 silver! I've no doubt Veronique herself will be extremely grateful as well, immortalizing her hero in one of her talented paintings!"

The people are obviously more moved by the promise of silver, but Procyon perks up at the mention of a painting.

"Please spread the word to any who might be able to find her" the Governor finishes, "before it's too late!" He storms down the aisle and out the door. Most people follow, and Procyon teleports away as the Abbot attempts to preach to an emptying room.

#### Following the Governor.

Procyon decides to follow the Governor, see if he can find any clues about the location of his missing daughter.

It's tricky; the Governer stops by a few more town centers to give a similar speech, offering various rewards for anyone who can find his lost daughter. After each speech he storms off towards the next location.

> CLAUDE BARLETTE (THE GOVERNOR): HP 25 Morale 11 Necro-Aura -d4 
> ▶ Death Touch: d10 + Shriveling spell 
> ▶ Shriveling Spell: Touch drains all stats by 1 for d20 hours. Regain d6 HP. 
> ▶ Levitate: Fly 60' a turn
> ▶ Anti-Magic: Any PC attempting to use a Relic or Ritual against him must first test Spirit DR16.

*I, the player, know that the Govenor is a necromancer and is responsible for the island's curse. I'm hoping to reveal that to Procyon in a fun way at the lighthouse.*

Procyon keeps teleporting to dark corners nad staying out of sight. Eventually the Governor storms out of Coral Town towards the Lighthouse.

- Spends 1d8, 1d10 to overcome the Govenor's Morale and remain undetected.

The Governor mutters something in a strange tone and yanks open the door. He disappears inside and Procyon sees the door seal with some kind of magical sigil. Not getting in that way.

#### Lighthouse Balcony

Procyon teleports up to the top of the lighthouse balcony. The place is a mess! The beacon has been smashed, the balcony is open to the elements and covered in seagull droppings. 

- Gains 1d8 for entering a new area.

As Procyon turns to look down the ruined staircase, something lands on his shell. He takes a feather and analyzes the creature. Just a simple seagull. It should--

Then another lands nearby. And another. And another. They all tilt their heads at the same time and begin pecking and pulling at his shiny metal bits. It's overwhelming.

> 4 Scavenging Seagulls: HP 4 Morale 6 Metallic feathers -d2 
> Claws d4
> Bite d4 (1-in-4 risk of infection)

- Gains 4d6 for sampling weak creatures
- Spends 1d4, 1d6 to resist the first seagull's attacks.
- Spends 1d6 to resist another's attacks.
- Spends 1d6, 1d10 to resist the 3rd.

The seagulls get agitated, dropping some of the other bits and bobs they had been holding.

- Gains 2d4 for scanning the small handfuls of treasure.
- Spends 1d4, 1d6 to resist the last seagull's damage. 
- Gains 1d10 for completing an area.

*In this instance I re-arranged the order of dice, letting Procyon obtain some samples and scan some treasure so he could resist the attacks. Up to you if this counts as cheating or not!*

Frustrated, the seagulls disperse, allowing Procyon to teleport down the stairs.

#### Lighthouse Quarters

Procyon carefully teleports to a rafter overlooking the lighthouse quarters. It's been abandoned for years; beds and tables covered in dust. Procyon waits for his teleporter to recharge as the sun sets below the horizon.

- Gains 1d8 for entering a new area.

A ghostly figure manifests in the room. The old spector strokes his beard and puts the finishes touches on a journal entry.

> Ghost: HP 7 Morale 7 No Armor
> ▶ Cutlass: d6
> Ethereal. Can , can be invisible until it attacks, then DR 14 to hit.

"Are ye satisfied? Can not a man write his memoirs in peace? BEGONE!"

- Spends 1d8, 1d6 to power the translator, overcome the ghosts morale, and adopt his strange accent.

Procyon speaks in an equally unsettling voice: "If ye harbor the Governor, surely one more is no trouble."

The ghost laughs. "That creature is nay human, and he's nay me guest. If not for his kind daughter, I'd be absorbed into his power."

Procyon perks up. "You've seen his daughter? Where? When?"

The ghost sits back down, looking thoughtful. "The girl came to paint atop the balcony, her father, the sage, accompanied her. I made the mistake of threatening them, but the sage overwhelmed me. Before I could be destroyed, the girl pleaded my case, and I was freed. The Governor and his daughter argued for a time and eventually she left, declaring that the views were likely better at the castle." 

His voice cracks a bit. "I fear I've been the cause of yet another lost daughter. Dammit it all." The ghost begins to pace angrily.

Procyon lights up at the information. "Thank you for the information. I will leave you." But before he can teleport away, the ghost reaches out a hand. "Please", the old man pleads, "take me with you. It's not safe for me here, not while the Governor keeps visiting. My soul is bonded to a purple crystal hidden in the stove."

Procyon considers, and then uses his force projector to open the stove and retrieve the crystal. "Very well. I will find a safer place to store your crystal." The ghost smiles a sad smile and fades away.

- Gains 1d20 for scanning a powerful object.
- Gains 2d4 for scanning the small pile of coins.
- Gains 1d10 for completing the area.

#### Skeleton Point Portcullis

Procyon teleports across the island, making his way to Skeleton Point castle. The old ghost remains alert within the crystal, occasionally dropping bits of advice.

"Are ye daft? Should we not await the sunrise to explore this fortress? At night this place is crawling with skeletons." 

Procyon is impatient however, choosing to ignore the ghost's warning. Surely his devices will keep him safe. No need to waste any more time in this miserable place.

- Gains 1d8 for entering a new area.

The courtyard looks like the result of a disgusting slaughter. Dozens of skeletons impaled on spikes wiggle and writhe, unable to escape their strange prisons. A few manage to twist free and shamble towards Procyon.

> 3 Skeletons: HP 5 Morale 8 No Armor 
> Grave Breath d2
> Dagger d4
> Small Axe d6

His sleep darts won't do any good here. Instead, Procyon relies one old-fashioned physics. 

- Spends 1d8, 2d4, 1d10 to smash the skeletons against the portcullis, overwhelming their HP.
- Gains 3d6 for taking samples.
- Gain 1d4 for scanning one of the skeleton's golden manacles.
- [Power Banks](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/overpowered?treasure=4-3,20-6,4-4&foe=6-2,6-3,6-4&obstacle=10-2,8-5&overpower=20&name=Frigid.Procyon.11&maxRows=4)

*There are dozens of skeletons here, and Procyon doesn't care to sample them all; so he won't benefit from clearing the area.*

Procyon sees a path through the portcullis, and teleports into the foyer.

#### Skeleton Point Foyer

Its dusty, dreary, and...BEAUTIFUL! A massive painting of a stormy mountain range, painted with haunted brush strokes and a deep sense of...frustration mixed with awe. Procyon doesn't dare to hope that this represents the talents of Veronique. If so, he's even more motivated to find her.

- Gains 1d8 for entering a new area.
- Gains 3d4 for scanning the painting. *It's not exactly 3 handfuls, but it is valuable.*
- Gains 1d10 for completing the area.
