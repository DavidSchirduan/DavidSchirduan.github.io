Become innocent and naive.</li><li><strong>The Black Goat.</strong> Horn and black velvet, and glass eyes. The wearer gets +3 charisma and +3 constitution. They always fail any saves to resist mind control and emotional manipulation. They find genteel civilization tiresome, and long to run into the woods where they can rut and fight and spill blood beneath the moon.</li><li><strong>The Bloody-faced Man.</strong> Crudely made from wood, painted red.

Halve all XP from treasure.</li><li><strong>The Flame.</strong> Stylized red and orange fire on silk. The wearer is immune to damage from fire, but takes double damage from other non-physical sources such as lightning etc. They are consumed by an urge to commit grand and exotic acts of arson.</li><li><strong>The Harlequin.</strong> Delicately patterned white and black porcelain, with gold inlay.

The wearer can memorize an extra spell of any level they can cast. Reaction rolls when they’re present are made at -3.</li><li><strong>The prisoner.</strong> A steel faceplate, with rivets and a grille over the eyes. +2 AC, -1 initiative, +1 chance to be surprised. The wearer seems subtly grotesque, everybody is sure that whatever’s under the mask must be horrific.</li><li><strong>The Refined Lady.</strong> Delicate china. Black inlaid script highlights well formed facial features. Double all XP gained for treasure. Gain no XP for anything that’s not treasure. Gain the minimum HP per Hit Dice on levelling up. The wearer gains a sophisticated taste in art, food, and company. Their subjective tastes are always flawless, nobody of class would disagree with them. Take a total of the wearer’s charisma and constitution scores: this is their sense of self. Each day that the mask is worn, reduce that sense of self by 1. When their sense of self is half its starting value, the mask begins to take over. If they ever act in a way that goes against the mask’s archetype, they can gain no XP for the next day. If their sense of self becomes 0, the mask takes over entirely, and they become an NPC. Removing a mask is difficult and dangerous. Make a Save vs Magic to do so, or else the mask is stuck fast to the wearer’s face and can’t be removed. Regardless of if the save is passed or failed, the attempt is incredibly painful; the wearer takes d4 damage, plus one more per day the mask’s been worn. </li></ul><p>The Mask Gallery will only be found once per expedition.

Towering glass-and-steel edifices, the splicing vats let you combine disparate living things to produce the various marvellous hybrids of the gardens.</p><p>The vats are two stories tall, glass tubes like a mad scientist might grow clones in. There’s all manner of tubes and pipes going in and out. The whole thing is filled with a slightly cloudy pinkish or greenish liquid.</p><p>There’s a hatch in the front, latched shut, bit enough for a person to crawl through. There’s another little inlet valve, just big enough to poke your finger into. There’s a control panel, too, a brass and blackiron plate with five unmarked buttons on it.</p><p>Using the Vats properly is difficult. The correct method works like this:</p><ol><li>Open the hatch, drain the fluid, and put the new test subject to be spliced into the vat.</li><li>Press the correct button, to fill the vat with amniotic fluid.</li><li>Introduce some genetic matter into the little inlet valve. Blood works fine, sap works fine, flesh works fine. Eggs and seeds will do, too.</li><li>Procedure A, B, C or D is selected, depending on the intended result. Perhaps a combination. Perhaps this is repeated.</li><li>The hatch is opened, and the newly modified creature comes out.</li></ol><ul><li>A. This procedure passes subtle traits from the donated genetic material onto the subject. So, put in a human’s DNA, and a human subject’s face might warp to look like them. Put in a tiger’s DNA, and a plant’s leaves develop tiger-stripes. ‘A’ stands for Appearance.</li><li>B. This procedure morphs the subject into a half-and-half hybrid with the introduced DNA. So, put in an owl and a bear, select ‘B’ and get an owlbear. Put in a human and a butterfly, and get a pixie. ‘B’ stands for ‘Blend’.</li><li>C. This procedure gives the subject a noteworthy trait from the genetic material introduced. Human DNA makes the subject sentient like a human. Spider DNA lets them spin webs. Bat DNA gives the echolocation. Mushroom DNA makes them spew reproductive spores. Elephant DNA makes them grow a trunk and tusks. ‘C’ stands for ‘capabilities’.</li><li>D. This procedure makes the effects of any previous stuff done to the subject inheritable. ‘D’ stands for ‘DNA’.</li></ul><p>Of course, players will probably get this wrong.</p><p>If they put genetic material into the tank in step 1, rather than a whole being, the vats produce a helpless foetus that dies when removed.</p><p>If they put another living thing through the hatch in stage 3, any button press produces a horrible cronenbergian mishmash monster.</p><p>If there’s no amniotic fluid added in stage 2, then each alteration causes horrible wounds. D20 damage, maybe.</p><p>Pressing buttons A-D without a subject results only in some splurting noises.</p><p>As a GM, you will have to homebrew some rules if the players do this to each other.
