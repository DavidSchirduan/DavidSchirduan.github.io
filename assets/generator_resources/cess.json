    "Changes": ["Miner’s Eyes - After so much time away from the sun your eyes water and sting in bright light. You are considered blinded in anything greater than low-light, unless you properly protect your eyes.", "Calcified Skin - Exposure to corrosive and permeable minerals has caused your skin to harden and be covered in calcified knots.",  "Chimney Lung - The festering tissues of your lungs have found that they work best when constantly filled with the sooty and grimy air. You are immune to the effects of impure air, but are reduced to coughing fits.",  "The Hollowed - Days of grueling work and traumatic violence have ground away your very humanity. You are incapable of feeling fear and sadness, but also incapable of feeling joy or remorse.",  "Drawn to the Deep - Dark and cramped places have begun to sing a siren’s song to you. You have an unnatural desire to explore and remain in these deep places.",  "Leadbite - Your body craves not just sustenance to keep its fibers and tissues alive, but hard metals such as lead as well. The craving must be met or the withdrawal sickness might kill you.",  "Tool Jinx - Everything you touch seems to wear and break. Any time you roll a 1 when using a tool, weapon, or piece of machinery, the implement breaks or catastrophically fails.",  "Worn to the Bone - Your body has ceased keeping up appearances. Wounds, weathering, and damage appear visibly on your body even after healing, giving you the appearance of a tattered corpse.",  "Metal Fear - Witnessing and being  surrounded by metal has made you  develop an aversion to it. You  cannot willingly don armor or wield metal weapons without entering  into a frightened state.",  "Beyond Sleep - Your body can never seem to rest easily. Anytime you wish to sleep, you must imbibe medicine or alcohol, or be placed under the effects of a spell."],
    "Boons": ["Miner’s Eyes - Even the smallest glimmer of light can reveal finite details to your eyes. Your pupils have adapted to the dim, providing you clarity where others would find only darkness.","Gem Wart - At first the growth seems unsightly but with a little rubbing, its true nature becomes apparent. A gemstone glitters from the fleshy socket of your skin, a treasure in disguise.","Heat Resistant - Billowing waves of dry, caustic heat flow over you like a spring breeze. Your body recognizes heat and does not panic or flash with pain.","Tempered skin - What might be an agonizing bruise to some is nothing more than a tickle to you. Like well- forged steel, your skin has absorbed and evolved to take a beating.","Around the Clock - Without sight of the sun and moon, the rhythms that sway other beings no longer apply to you. You function just as well as any other without the need to sleep.","Song of Metal - The clang of brass or the bellow of iron, the song each sings tells you from where in the ground it was ferreted. Each metal has its own tune and you know all of them.","Chisel Fingers - Iron runs through your hands, hardening your fingernails. Your fingernails function as chisels or a similar tool.","Breaker - Some were built to make, you were built to break. At the cost of 1d6 HP you may break apart a piece of machinery, a sturdy door, or other artificial construction.","Iron-Handed - Heavy hands from labor make anything a weapon. You may wield anything as an improvised weapon, with damage equal to a weapon of similar weight and size.","Tinker, Thinker, Maker - You are adept at improvising what you need. Once per day, you may spend 1d3 hours to combine any 2 common tools into a tool of your choice."],
