  "Dust Colosseum","Small time fighting pits. Anything may fight as long as they are not taller than three feet. A notorious place where many individuals have lost their life savings as well as their lives.",
  "Edge Maze","Upon first glance this well- manicured maze appears docile and demure. There is a reason there are few who wander its meandering paths; all of the bushes are of the Clear-Edge variety.

  "Eel Farm & Fun","Bins of wriggling, slimy eels are curated and sold by the pound.

  "The Eggery","Provided one can withstand the smell of a thousand birds on the way past the shit-stained exterior, the inside of the dim pub is filled with culinary delights. Custards, omelets, quiches, and shakshuka of the most delectable sort may be acquired. However, the pervasive din of cooing birds is unnerving.",

Legends abound regarding the creature the appendages came from and chunks often go missing as ruffians see them as good luck trophies.",
  "Green Fountain","Whether it is from the discoloring of the statues at its center, or some other more sinister reason, the waters that gush from the mythological fish forever frozen in copper run green. This does not stop a very stubborn bunch of duckweed from trying to populate the water, but it does keep away most thirsty folks.",
  "Grim-Roost","A once proud and stalwart redoubt has been razed and occupied by a surly dragon.

No one knows who it is who does the hanging, but the words “justice is found” is often painted in blood on the stone.",
  "Hemmingdaw's Tapestries","A small octagonal shop filled with the constant shuffle of looms and strings.

  "Paradis Watch","Reaching nearly as high as one of the Spires, this huge watchtower looms silently over its residents.

  "Seebee Jeebee's","A legendary bar and venue, known to host some of the most prominent and up-and-coming bands and acts. Despite its fame and importance to the city’s culture, the place remains a cheap, filthy, and irredeemable dive, qualities that everyone agrees make it great.",
  "Snowy Clocktower","The chimes of this clock have kept generations of city dwellers informed of the time. It stands as a bastion of normalcy in a place that is constantly bubbling with oddities.

Lots are drawn every year for the unfortunate soul that must scrap off the time-face.",
  "Soup Kitchen","Free to all who enter there is always food to be had regardless of the hour. A surly head cook keeps order in the back with fearsome growls and shouts. It is a mystery where all of the ingredients come from, as the stoves are always on and hot stews ready to be ladled.",
  "Swifts Sweeps","The only union of certified chimney sweeps in the city. They have a single storefront where appointments can be made.

  "Speck's Livery","A well-kept establishment with healthy creatures for sale. However, all of the animals come with dappled coats in strange patterns.
