    "Quoter": "Oliver “Optimistic Ollie” Krutel, Man on the Street",
    "Description": "Caught between the political engines of Towers, Sewers, and the Gatehouse, the Heights and Depths could be considered an archetypal Bridge district, insofar as the average traveler is concerned. Awful Birds (pg.XX) perch on spires, rooftop gardens are carefully tended, the Road is busy with comings and goings, and baskets full of “fishermen” are lowered over the side of the Bridge to haul strange and unlikely catches into the Heights. In the Depths, below the cobbles, the Trolls recycle waste from above, adventurous sorts seek ancient ruins, and dark dealings are wrought—away from prying eyes.",

      "Name": "Beaumont Apted",
      "Description": "A high-strung Aristocrat with the tallest Tower anyone has ever seen, who has sealed off all its lower entrances to keep out the rabble. Less recluse, more rampant, paranoid xenophobe, Beaumont has never actually set foot outside the Tower. He uses complex basket/pulley systems for the movement of goods and a huge copper megaphone to yell proclamations across the district, acting as de facto “governor” of the Heights. He doesn’t know about the Sewer entrances under his Tower."

      "Name": "Mistah DeBris (Skill 14, Stamina 32)",
      "Description": "DeBris controls the underside of this district as the Local Sewer Baron of the Depths. Years of greed and corpulence have left this Troll an immobile (but still terribly dangerous) tumor, burrowed in the cistern below the Towers. He takes a cut of everything the Sewer-working Trolls find, and has built up quite a hoard within the hollowed-out Pile."

      "Name": "Fulk Two-Pebs",
      "Description": "Somehow this cart-pushing, filthy old man is everywhere, setting up his rolling “toll gate” and charging two pebbles to pass, though he doesn’t really do anything to stop those who refuse to pay his toll. He’s universally tolerated by all but the Turnpike Guilds, because (unlike them) he’s somehow actually collecting."

      "Name": "Miranda “Make-Way Mim” Liveswell",
      "Description": "By day, Make-Way Mim makes a living as a rickshaw puller, transporting people and goods up and down the district with speed and efficiency that’s nigh-supernatural. By night, she operates as an agent of the local Anti-Tower League: her work is much the same, but with the added goal of pulling down Beaumont’s Tower."

      "Name": "Captain Irving Erstwhile (Skill 8, Stamina 8)",
      "Description": "Thickly mustachioed commander of the local Gatehouse and subtle manipulator of the political elite. While the Aristocrats and Sewer Union both believe he’s on their side, Erstwhile quietly takes bribes from both to fund his eventual takeover."

      "Description": "The oldest, craggiest Gruffolk anyone has ever seen. Nanny Rook maintains The Castle and Crow—inn, tavern, and store of general sundries. She’d still be walking the Bridge if she had either of her legs, but she knows her great grandkids are walking it for her."

    "Description": "Sometime in the distant past, a massive rock fell from the sky and landed on this district. The Bridge did not collapse but The Rock has attracted strange sorts and produces stranger influences.

      "Name": "Mayor Godfrey Burp (Skill 12, Stamina 5)",
      "Description": "A sentient, gas-based lifeform fished up from the Void twenty years ago; he inhabits a bulbous metallic suit and will do anything to keep his position as mayor.

      "Name": "Doc Azoth",
      "Description": "A Stonewright who theorizes that all life is essentially clay, and clay is just soft stone.

      "Name": "Wally (Skill 6, Stamina 16)",
      "Description": "No one has seen Wally beyond their long gloved hand poking up through the cobbles or out of holes in the wall. Their voice—described as the auditory equivalent to a rotten egg—leaks through the stones, enticing passersby to approach. Wally specializes in rare and outlandish goods, which they offer in return for trades or bizarre favors."

      "Name": "Hank, Molly, and Oakes (Skill 9, Stamina 12)",
      "Description": "A trio of self-described adventurers and Under-Delvers who semi-retired in Craterton years ago. They are local heroes after clearing out an Under-Thing-infested tomb years back, and have been riding that wave ever since. Their group is knowledgeable and friendly, but not about to be upstaged.

      "Name": "The Rock Festival",

    "Description": "Living space on any span of The Bridge is limited, but occupants of this district have brought the population density to new heights. A single footpath cuts directly through the Squeeze, barely wide enough to fit a solitary traveler; hundreds of side alleys stem from it, jutting into the sardined housing structures to each side. Much of the local populace make use of roofways and window-to-window travel—the idea of personal space and privacy is all but foreign to the average citizen.",

      "Name": "The Jetsam Clan",
      "Description": "A large huddle of Coblins that prowl the street level, scavenging everything dropped from the roofs above to be repurposed, sold off, or dumped unceremoniously into the sewers. Anything lost might find its way into the Jetsam’s many, many hands."

      "Name": "Farmers Market",
      "Description": "Like most of the Bridge, gardens can only be grown on roofs and vertical terraces, but there isn’t even room to trade their produce on the Squeeze’s street level.
