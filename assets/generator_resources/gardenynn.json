It knows how many are present, if any are injured, and how heavy they all are. From this, it can make a good guess as to who makes the best victim. Typically, this will be whoever is bringing up the rear. Sometimes, it waits for a group of victims to disperse to explore the room, and grabs somebody who stands over its pit undefended.</p><p>When the spider makes its move, a section of floorboards lift up, and its front half (face and front legs) emerges from beneath.

An intact human brain floats in the fluid, with wires linking where the spinal column would be to a small mechanism set in the jar's base. Each jar is labelled to say whose brain it contains, and when they were interred.</p><p>Each jar's fluid is a nutrient solution designed to keep the brain within alive. Occasionally, a bubble rises to the surface as the jar's mechanisms keep the fluid oxygenated. The mechanism links to a small metal grille in the front of the jar; this is how the brain within communicates in a tinny, staticky voice. The brains are torpid and dormant as the PCs enter, but can be roused by shaking their jars or speaking directly into the grille at the front of their jar, for example.</p><p>Of the brains present, at least one will be an intellectual figure (recent or historical) known to the PCs. There's a 1-in-4 chance that it's somebody directly connected to the subject of the PCs' research. Conversing with this figure might answer all sorts of questions, and adds 4 to the party's Progress Score if their area of knowledge is relevant. Being stuck in a jar has almost certainly given the brain a long time to spend in self-reflection with little external stimulus. It has no doubt become deeply strange in its outlook and priorities.</p><p>The remaining brains are split roughly evenly between those incapable of intelligible communication due to language barriers, those incapable of intelligible communication due to total jar-induced madness, those unable to be roused from their torpor, and those with little worth saying.</p><p>A Jarred Brain exists in a weird state halfway between life and death. It is affected just as easily by magic that affects the living, the dead and the undead. 1-in-4 encounters here will always be with Floating Brains.</p>"

You're playing by their rules, now.</p><p>Roll a d12 to determine who you meet:</p><ol><li>Don Quixote, who tilted at windmills.</li><li>Frankenstein's Monster, who was built from corpses.</li><li>Grendel, a monstrous inhabitant of the wilderness, who hates noise and celebration, one arm torn clean off.</li><li>Doctor Faustus, an occultist who regrets selling his soul.</li><li>Count Dracula, the monstrous vampire.</li><li>Lady Macbeth, ambitious and murderous, and of much-degraded sanity.</li><li>The Ghost of Christmas Future, who delivers dire warnings to the mean-spirited.</li><li>Bluebeard, a dashingly handsome murderer of his many wives.</li><li>Sir Lancelot, brilliant knight and enthusiastic adulterer.</li><li>Robin Hood, a charitable bandit and excellent shot.</li><li>Puck, the mischievous fairy sprite.</li><li>Jack the Giant-Slayer, young and reckless, but cunning.</li></ol><p>Vulnerabilities, quirks, powers or immunities appropriate for their character. </p><p>Attacks or other actions against them that do not fit the setting or narrative style of the work they are from fail automatically.

Tone down any descriptions of gore and violence.</li><li>Conversely, for characters from more bloody and brutal tales, ratchet the violence all the way up.</li><li>Horror characters call for appropriately Gothic lighting and effects.</li><li>Technology reverts to that of the time period of the character's setting.

Driven by glitching muscle memory and scrambled genetic instincts. A broken democracy of mismatched anatomies. Tragically incomplete.</p><p>They want to be a whole organism. They do this by incorporating parts from those they encounter, torn off and jammed into the Crawling Thing's amalgamated flesh.</p><p>Slow. Basically blind and deaf-but not completely, allowing a dim awareness.</p><p>If its attack hits, it latches onto the victim and begins incorporating their flesh into itself. Each round thereafter it deals damage automatically and heals by that much. To remove it, pass a Strength check or kill it.</p>"

Like the spiritual equivalent of weaponizing nuclear waste. </p><p>It's barely more than a presence. A shimmer in the air, a mirage. Out of the corner of your eye, an impression of humanoid silhouettes, screaming faces, grasping hands. The smell of dust and rusty water. </p><p>It should not be. Every conscious being knows that what has been done is degenerate, instinctively finds the presence horrifying. They loathe and fear it. </p><p>The Librarians use these beings to track down thieves and spies. They don't seem to mind their presence at all.</p><p>Apparitions are gaseous beings, immune to all physical damage except that caused by magical items. They can pass through permeable objects, and are unaffected by fire, poison, etc.</p><p>Merely being in an Apparition's presence is painful. Each round, take 1 automatic damage. </p><p>Attacking it (in melee, at range, with spells, or in any other way) forces you to concentrate on it, also dealing 1 automatic damage. </p><p>Any damage dealt by the Apparition also permanently reduces your lowest attribute by that much.</p><p>If anybody is killed by taking damage from the Apparition, their soul is ripped from their body, twisted and mutilated-become a Shade under its total control.</p><p>If an Apparition reduces an attribute to 0, they syphon out their target's soul and consume it. It's gone forever-that person can never be recovered or resurrected. As a final insult, the apparition heals all damage when they consume a soul in this way.</p>"

Black Ooze is a simple life form that grows in unattended nooks and crannies. It feeds on mental energy. If it touches you, it can digest your brainwaves, causing it to grow rapidly as it absorbs and incorporates your mind. It oozes like an amoeba. It creeps under floorboards and behind wallpaper.

Can climb up walls, squeeze through gaps, etc.</p><p>Mental Digestion has a bonus to hit equal to the Ooze's current HD and HP(an ooze with 5 HP left is HD 5 and has +5 to hit). Every time you touch it, it gets to make a free Mental Digestion attack against you.</p><p>Mental Digestion deals damage equal to d6 plus the target's current Intelligence modifier to the target's Intelligence score (a target with 8 Intelligence takes d6-1 Intelligence damage, because they have a –1 Intelligence modifier).
