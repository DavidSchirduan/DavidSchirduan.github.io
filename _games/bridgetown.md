## What Makes Bridgetown Different?

**A Talky Storybook Setting**. More than a simple roadway, many folks live their entire lives wandering the Bridge. Goat-legged Gruffolk, tiny Coblin huddles, magical stone masons, and haunted rock golems give the Bridge a mythical storybook vibe. Or maybe that’s just the Troll stench.

**Pastoral Crumbling Cities**. Tight spaces, towering buildings, hazardous walkways, and lively characters fill the Bridge near to bursting. Land–and everything that goes in or on it–is at a premium on the Bridge. Rooftop gardens eke out food, protected groves offer precious timber, and if you want the luxury of metal you have to rip up the bones of the Bridge itself to get some. The law of the land is barter and trade, and folk sell things dearly.

**Infinite, Liminal, and Narrow**. The Bridge is a narrow band of solid ground straddling the gap between the infinite Sky above and the murky depths of the Under. It is wide enough for about 50 average-sized humans to stand shoulder-to-shoulder across it (the width of a modern 4-lane highway). You could walk it for a hundred years, and the only end you’d find is your own.

**Whispers In The Stones**: The Bridge is alive, after a fashion, and those with an ear for its voice can learn its secrets. Some may even become Stonewrights- beloved and hated keepers of old lore who can tease the magic out of disintegrating stone.

**A Bridge To Elsewhere?** Every now and then, something especially peculiar happens. The Under spits up something real, or things drop out of the empty Sky. Rarer still, sometimes those things are people. These strange out-of-towners claim they’re from other places; other worlds beyond the Bridge. Maybe you can find a way to travel between these various spheres?
