## How Does it Play?

> "The choices on your playsheet are compelling, and the card-slotting mechanic is easily the strongest point of the game." – [Ludicrous Gaming](http://ludicrusgaming.blogspot.com/2015/04/review-mythic-mortals.html)

You play as yourself suddenly granted incredible and unstable abilities. Your powers, weapons, and flaws change every few turns, forcing you to constantly adapt.

You'll be fighting in your hometown, defending your school from monsters, and saving your world from utter destruction. Once you master your powers and your cards, then you will **Be The Hero**!

> "Mythic Mortals has a very elegant system for constantly shifting your powers. Each round of combat feels fresh and fun." - [James D’Amato](http://oneshotpodcast.com/one-shot/120-mythic-mortals/)

> "Oh, that's cool!" - repeated several times by Satine Phoenix [playing as The Hunter](http://gameschool.tsrpn.com/2018/07/15/126-mythic-mortals/)
