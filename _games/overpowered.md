### SETUP

1. Select a tabletop rpg adventure module that uses math. Check out the [High Scores](#high-scores) for suggestions.
2. Gather four of each die size: <span class="d4">d4</span>, <span class="d6">d6</span>, <span class="d8">d8</span>, <span class="d10">d10</span>, <span class="d12">d12</span>, <span class="d20">d20</span>. (Or use the <a target="_blank" href="/overpowered-app">Dice App</a>)
3. Roll a <span class="d4">d4</span> and a <span class="d20">d20</span>. Put these in your first column.
4. Roll a <span class="d6">d6</span> and a <span class="d12">d12</span>. Put these in your second column.
5. Roll a <span class="d8">d8</span> and a <span class="d10">d10</span>. Put these in your third column.

The columns represent your bot’s Power Banks, and each Bank may contain up to 4 dice. The dice can be spent to Power your bot’s devices. Use those devices to accomplish goals and gain more dice.

### HOW TO PLAY

1. From the adventure module, read the current area your bot is exploring, including all secrets.
2. Envision how your bot will accomplish their goals. What stands in their way?
3. Use your bot’s devices to overcome threats, hazards, and obstacles. Spend dice to use devices.
4. Gain more dice by accomplishing your bot’s goals.
5. Choose which area to enter next, and begin at step 1.

### BOT GOALS

Your bot’s programming rewards them with new Power dice whenever they achieve a goal. 

* Gain a <span class="d4">d4</span> for each handful of treasure scanned.
* Gain a <span class="d20">d20</span> after scanning a powerful object.
* Gain a <span class="d6">d6</span> after scanning a weak creature.
* Gain a <span class="d12">d12</span> after scanning a strong creature.
* Gain a <span class="d8">d8</span> when entering a new area.
* Gain a <span class="d10">d10</span> after scanning everything in an area.

When you gain a die, roll it and add it to the bottom of the Power Bank. 

<table>
  <tr>
  <td><span class="d4">d4</span>s and <span class="d20">d20</span>s go in the first column</td>
  <td><span class="d6">d6</span>s and <span class="d12">d12</span>s in the second column</td>
  <td><span class="d8">d8</span>s and <span class="d10">d10</span>s in the third column</td>
  </tr>
</table>

A <span class="d20">d20</span> showing [5] and a <span class="d6">d6</span> showing [5] are both worth 5 Power.

If there are more than 4 dice in any Power Bank, remove the top die and gain that much Overpower. Overpower represents your high score, and can be spent on Upgrades.

### SPEND DICE TO USE TOOLS

Unfortunately your bot’s scanner has limited range, so you must be careful. Treasure is often guarded, most creatures don't like being scanned, and dangerous hazards or obstacles block your progress. Spend dice from your Power Banks to activate your devices and accomplish your goals.

1. Read about the creature, hazard, or obstacle.
2. Pick a single Stat to overcome. If no stat makes sense, just use “**10**” as it’s Stat.
3. Choose which of your tools will be most effective here.
4. Spend one or more dice to activate that tool. Spend enough Power to exceed the obstacle's Stat.
5. The creature can now be scanned, the hazard is not a threat, and the obstacle will no longer hinder you.

### ADVICE

**Pick your Battles**. Not every treasure is worth scanning, not every area is worth completing. Sometimes it’s best to move on to a new area.

**A negative score can still be a high score!** Just because an adventure drops you into the negative doesn’t mean it’s an invalid score. Some adventures can only be completed with a negative Overpower score.

**Choose your Exit**. At some point pressing forward isn’t worth the trouble. Feel free to end an adventure at any point. This is part of the strategy and your score is still valid!

#### UPGRADES

Upgrades can be purchased by spending your Overpower score. All upgrades can be purchased multiple times, as often as needed. You may choose to spend Overpower that you don’t have, going into the negative.

* **Re-roll**. Spend 10 Overpower to re-roll all of the dice in your Power Banks.
* **Gain Dice**. Spend 40 Overpower to add 1<span class="d4">d4</span>, 1<span class="d6">d6</span>, 1<span class="d8">d8</span>, 1<span class="d10">d10</span>, 1<span class="d12">d12</span>, and 1<span class="d20">d20</span> to your Power Banks.
* **Gain New Row**. Spend 100 Overpower to upgrade to all three Power Banks. Each Power can now hold one additional die.
