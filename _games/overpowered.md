## Tribute High Scores

As I clear more adventures I'll post my scores here. How do you compare?

- [Tomb of the Serpent Kings](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/252934/Tomb-of-the-Serpent-Kings--Deluxe-Print-Edition). 109 Tribute.  
*A good starter, some easy wins up front and then some difficult choices about where to explore.*
- [Sepulchre of the Seven](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/366868/The-Sepulchre-of-Seven?term=sepulchre+of+). 84 Tribute.  
*A difficult adventure, but with LOTS of treasure. I failed my first try, and my second was okay. Might try it again someday. This one was painful to speedrun because it's so beautiful and rich; I felt like a vandal running through it guns blazing.*
- [The Waking of Willowby Hall](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348439/The-Waking-of-Willowby-Hall). 109 Tribute.  
*After I immediately slew Bonebreaker Tom, the rest of the adventure was a breeze!*
- [The Isle of the Plangent Mage](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348884/The-Isle-of-the-Plangent-Mage). 70 Tribute.  
*My wife played through this one, and even as someone who never GMed a game she enjoyed the chance to play through an adventure in a brrezy, accelerated way.*

### Detailed play report of Tomb of the Serpent Kings.

Ceylon-4 is ejected from the Grand Cathedral orbiting earth. The wind whips past its face and the grounds grows larger in its one ocular sensor. After it smashed into the earth, Ceylon-4 leaps from the crater and begins sprinting towards the supposed tomb, eager to fulfill its programming and recover valuable power for Her Eminance.
