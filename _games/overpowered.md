## Tribute High Scores

As I clear more adventures I'll post my scores here. Share your high scores with #OverpoweredSR, and see if you can beat me!

- [Sepulchre of the Seven](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/366868/The-Sepulchre-of-Seven?term=sepulchre+of+). 84 Tribute.  
*A difficult adventure, but with LOTS of treasure. I failed my first try, and my second was okay. Might try it again someday. This one was painful to speedrun because it's so beautiful and rich; I felt like a vandal running through it guns blazing.*
- [The Waking of Willowby Hall](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348439/The-Waking-of-Willowby-Hall). 109 Tribute.  
*After I immediately slew Bonebreaker Tom, the rest of the adventure was a breeze!*
- [The Isle of the Plangent Mage](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348884/The-Isle-of-the-Plangent-Mage). 70 Tribute.  
*My wife played through this one, and even as someone who never GMed a game she enjoyed the chance to play through an adventure in a breezy, accelerated way.*

## Detailed play report of [Tomb of the Serpent Kings](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/252934/Tomb-of-the-Serpent-Kings--Deluxe-Print-Edition).

Ceylon-4 is ejected from the Grand Cathedral orbiting earth. The wind whips past its face and the grounds grows larger in its one ocular sensor. After it smashed into the earth, Ceylon-4 leaps from the crater and begins sprinting towards the supposed tomb, eager to fulfill its programming and recover valuable power for Her Eminance.

Before going any further, I want to re-roll since my d12 is showing a 1. I bet I can get a better starting pool.

![OSRexample2.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample2.png)

Much better! Now let's enter the first room.

**Rooms 1, 2, 2** Break two snake statues, resist two poison gas traps (d6 damage each), loot amulets.

— Spend d4 + d6 (total: 8), and d12 (total 9) to beat both 6s from the gas traps.
+ Gain 2d8 for overcoming both poison gas obstacles, 1d4 for a handful of treasure, 2d10 for clearing rooms

![OSRexample3.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample3.png)

**3,4** Skip them, the real loot is probably deeper in. *I know there is some loot in these rooms, but I was eager to get further in the dungeon and started skipping rooms more liberally.

**5** Hammer Trap (2d6+4 = 16 highest damage).

— Spend d4, d8, d8 (total 17)
+ Gain 1d8 for overcoming the obstacle, 1d10 cleared the room.

**7, 8** Ceylon-4 automatically detects the hidden passage with its scanner, and dashes down the stairs.

**9, 10** Melt the statue with the laser sword, loot the secret treasure room. Since this didn't require a save or check, it didn't cost any dice. Puzzles are similarly solved freely.

+ Gain 1d4 for the treasure.

![OSRexample6.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample6.png)

**11** Two mummy claws (6 damage).

— Spend 1d8, 1d10
+ Gain 2d6, 1d10

![OSRexample1.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample1.png)

— Spend 2d10
+ Gain 1d4, 1d8, 1d10

**25** Pit Trap (12 damage)

— Spend 1d8, 1d10
+ Gain 1d8, 1d10 (not enough treasure to count as a handful)

![OSRexample1.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample1.png)

**26, 27, 28** I know the big treasure room lies behind this thick door. I COULD blast through it, but I decide I want to find the key to this door so I don't damage anything inside. I also want to fight a big boss because that sounds like fun.

**30** Sacrifice Pit (12 damage)

— Spend 2d10
+ Gain 1d4, 1d8, 1d10

![OSRexample1.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample1.png)

![OSRexample1.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample1.png)

**33** Statue puzzle, poison gas (6 damage), gold pile

— Spend 1d8

**34** Magic Eggs

+ Gain 1d20 for absorbing a magical item

![OSRexample1.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample1.png)

**35** Pit trap deals 6 damage three times, and then another 12 damage (30 total to overcome). I assumed the max damage in a large trap. A smarter robot might avoid more of that damage, but Ceylon-4 is more direct.

+ Gain 1d8, 1d10

![OSRexample1.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample1.png)

- I now have the key to the treasure room

![OSRexample1.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample1.png)

**28, 29** Big Treasure Room. The adventure doesn't explicitly say what lies beyond. But as a fun reward I'll give myself 2 magic items.

+ Gain 2d20

![OSRexample1.png](/images/overpoweredExamples/OSRexample1.png)

**Tribute Rerolling** Whenever an adventure ends, I try to re-roll the dice a bunch of times to see what my high score can be with my final pool. By this point there's always at least one die showing a "1". 

I ended up re-rolling 8 times before I settled on my final score.

1. 120
2. 107
3. 103
4. 85
5. 102
6. 99
7. 84
8. 109

- Final Tribute Score for Tomb of the Serpent Kings: 109
- Playtime: 65 minutes
