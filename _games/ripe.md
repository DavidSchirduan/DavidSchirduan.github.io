## About RIPE

**You are an Elder.** You’ve done a little of everything, mastered many skills, and have survived hundreds of trials and dangers. You’re not a young fool who bets on raw strength or blind luck. Rather, you rely on your teammates, experience, and careful planning to achieve your goals.

**Your Harvester is Coming.** Harvesters descend from the sky in a rainbow trail of light and smoke. They make landfall with an earth-shaking crash and emerge from the smoking crater with one goal: Capture their target.

**You Can’t do This Alone.** Outcast by society and hunted by Harvesters, Elders tend to stick together. Instead of taking turns, RIPE has a heavy focus on coordinated teamwork. The players succeed or fail together.
